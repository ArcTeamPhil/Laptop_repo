","FBLA, Church Volunteer services, Yearbook, York High Golf Team",," The challenging aspects of engineering have always intrigued me. From Linkin Logs to K'nex, I was always building things and figuring out how they worked. I have never been the girl that played with Barbies; I always picked up Legos. Figuring out how bringing multiple items together to build one machine that worked was more enticing and amusing than to play dress up with Barbies. 
 I like being able to create solutions to problems that most people would turn away from. To me, engineering is about doing something for the greater good that makes the lives of people easier. I love to be a creative person, and engineering would allow me to be creative every day and provide new perspectives. Being an engineer means that you have some of the biggest impacts on the world and that's what I want in life; I want to leave an impact on every person or thing I come across, and being an engineer would allow me to do just that. "," During my chemistry class, we were presented with a STEM challenge. We had to program a robotic system using all aspects of the STEM program. The robot had to be able to neutralize a deadly gas, balance frequency waves, weld broken metal pieces back together, and calculate the proper velocity and angle the machine would need to jump over a chasm. In my task, I took the lead in figuring out the proper formula needed to counteract the nitric acid and allowing for the robot to get first in the science portion of the challenge. I then took the lead again in the engineering aspect when the robot had to weld the support bridges back into place. The support bridges were broken in three spots: the joints, the boards, and the support beams, by me taking the lead in this aspect, our group was then able to claim first in the engineering area, but our team landed third in the overall competition."," I am persistent. I believe persistence is a key quality in succeeding in anything. If chosen for this program I will give nothing but my full attention, positive attitude, and I will approach every task and challenge with an open mind. As a second year Head Editor for my school's yearbook, I have responsibilities similar to that of a project manager. I oversee the whole process and am solely responsible for making sure that the yearbook is up to VHSL standards. Whenever I am presented with a challenge, I step back and I think it out in a logical way, and then I can apply it to whatever is needed. By doing this, it allows me to see the problem holistically and can assess all aspects of the issue to find the best possible solution. For example, I was faced with moving a computer desk that was twice my size and shaped awkwardly. I stepped back, looked at the door frames that were in the way, and figured out that the desk needed to be at a certain angle for it to pass through without damaging the surrounding area.

I have several role models who have inspired and encouraged me along the path of engineering and design. I have been successful in my advanced math classes, breaking the stereotype that girls are not good in math.

My interest in engineering started in elementary school. When I was in fifth grade I asked for a circuit set for Christmas so I could learn how electricity works. I spent countless hours designing different circuits and incorporating things I found around the house including speakers and strings of light. I thought this was fascinating. I became further inspired to become an engineer by my my uncle and my next door neighbor.

My neighbor spends his free time taking apart old cars and making ‘new’ ones or fixing others out of the spare parts. In the summer and after school, I help him for several hours each day while he explains what each part does and what it’s purpose is. I particularly enjoy the satisfaction of figuring out what is wrong with a car and being able to fix it, like a puzzle. It can be difficult and time consuming, requiring multiple attempts until it works properly. I get to use my brain and my skills to overcome the problem and find a solution.

My uncle has his PhD in mechanical engineering. He is currently the lead engineer for a well known corporation. I think it is amazing that his designs are used in real life applications. He designs engines and even a ball bearing for one of the space shuttles. I always enjoy hearing about his work and learning about how he meets challenges and advances technology in his field. His enthusiasm for his job has encouraged me to become an engineer so that I can share my ideas and make a difference in this world.

I would like to become an engineer so I can use my passion and creativity  to figure out new ways to improve the operations of the environment. Women are underrepresented in the STEM field. I would like to change that.","A friend and I have our driving learner's permit. In order to obtain a driver’s license, we need to have driven for forty hours. We decided to apply what we learned in our computer science class and code a program that could make logging hours more efficient. The program uses a scanner to input data from the user including time spent driving, weather conditions, and whether or not it was nighttime and outputs a table displaying the information. I would like to increase my programming abilities to be able to solve problems such as this. While this problem was simple, I would like to eventually solve more complicated ones that could be applied to an important cause in fields such as healthcare or research.","I am hardworking and extremely determined. I strive to do my best in everything I do. I am certain that this program will further my interest in engineering and problem solving. Furthermore, after I have finished this program I will be one step closer to becoming an engineer who can make a difference in the world. I am also very interested in attending the College of Engineering at Virginia Tech after high school as it the largest in the state and provides helpful resources and laboratories for research. I also would like to break the stereotype and become a woman in the field of  STEM, specifically engineering. Many young women have the capability to solve complex problems but are not given the chance. I have always been in the top math classes from elementary school to high school and would like to use this gift to design and inspire. It is my dream to become an engineer so I can encourage other young women to pursue their dream career in a male dominated field. I am incredibly excited to be a part of this program.","By checking this box, I am electronically signing this online application and acknowledging that the information I have provided is accurate to the best of my knowledge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My mother is a Chemical Engineer, my grandfather is a Mechanical Engineer and my brother is currently studying at the University of Virginia to become a Nano-Medical Engineer. This first-hand exposure to the engineering world through my family has sparked my interest in the occupation. I am persuing engineering as a future career because I enjoy the problem solving and critical thinking aspects.","One of my most rewarding team experiences was playing field hockey my sophomore year of high school. Although I had been involved in other athletic activities, this was my first time playing field hockey. I came into tryouts completely inexperienced, but ready to learn. It was intimidating being around players who were far more experienced than me. We trained every day, each practice more challenging than the one before. My teammates and I often stayed late after practice or went on extra runs together to build our skills and endurance. With the support of my teammates and determination to be better, I made two goals and helped our team earn a victory in our first game. We truly could not have had a successful season without the support each other.
","I would be honored to be selected for this prestigious program because it would help grow my engineering skills. I am enthusiastic, ready to learn, and enjoy collaborating in a team environment. I feel that women in engineering deserve more recognition and awareness. This program is something that I feel provides the inspiration to the next generations of female engineers. I was the only girl in my engineering class my sophomore year. My teacher was extremely sexist and often projected to the class his negative views on women in the engineering field. This program shows that female engineers are just as valuable as males. If selected for this program, I would use the knowledge gained to encourage other women and continue my involvement in the engineering field.

During my freshman year, every PACE class was given an elective tour, and it was there that I was introduced to computer science. Each teacher that teaches the subject is enthusiastic and constantly learning new things and sharing them with the class.
	Last year when I was taking the introductory level class, I was surprised to find that the class setting was unlike any of my other classes, which focus on individual work. The goal of the class is to challenge ourselves to become the best, most efficient programmers we can be. Teamwork is encourages, and many of the notes were taken as a group. My teacher was enthusiastic and often told us that if we wanted answers to our many questions then we would have to take the next class.
	So here I am, taking an AP class, where often the things we learn are challenging and difficult to master. There are massive amount of classwork and homework, but the work is always fun and challenging. Compared to my other classes, computer science definitely requires the most work, but is also the most rewarding.","This year the band leadership team is attempting to make the annual band banquet more attended and more personal. Usually the parents plan the location, decorations, and menu, but this year we want to place it in the hands of the students. 
	Currently we have decided the location and music, but the decorations, menu and ticket price are all up in the air. The tickets without fundraising would cost up to thirty dollars apiece which is more than some people can afford, so in order to make the event more accessible, we would have to fundraise to lower the cost, but then the question of how do we fundraise arose. Do we have a car wash? Bake sale? Or do we just use leftover funds from our flag fundraiser? We eventually decided to hold multiple car washes and have a “spirit night” at a local restaurant.
	Then the issue of how we would make/buy our decorations came up. We learned after picking the theme of the event that the dance team, which had already hosted their banquet, had a similar theme and were willing to give us the centerpieces they made, since they make new ones every year. Also, the venue said that they would provide caterers and place settings; all we would have to do is choose the menu.
	Planning an event where people come from different backgrounds and economic situations is difficult, but working with a small team of widely diverse people to accommodate for a very large group of people is also very rewarding. If done correctly we could make this the most attended band banquet yet!","I love computer science. As soon as I started my first week of classes, I was hooked. It has gotten much more challenging and I find that I like it even more now. I love the challenge of finding solutions and working with my group to find the best way to get results. 
Last semester we were given an assignment that we were not allowed to discuss with our classmates. We had to read in over 300 pages from the book “Robin Hood” and separate them into a data file, find the number of works (which brought up a discussion of what makes a word), as well as more challenging things like removing all of the page numbers and roman numerals, as well as counting the number of times an inputted word/phrase occurs. At the time we had not yet learned the “split” method, which would have made it a breeze.
Recently we completed the PixLab problem, which required us to figure out how filters work and how to edit pictures using code. Essentially it was a behind the scenes look at most photo shopping programs. We used so many for loops in each question I lost count of how many I had written. 
Problems like these make me understand the impact that computer science has on everyday life and gives me a new appreciation for those who came before me in the field. I wish to have an impact on future coders lives as the ones before me have had on mine.

As the college search process nears in my high school years, the question asked at every family gathering is the dreaded “so, have you thought about what you want to study?” My normal response is a nervous laugh, considering my interest in just about everything. I enjoy the humanities and public speaking, prosper in the practicality of math, and feel comfortable heating chemicals in the lab. However, engineering has caught my attention over the last year because I realize an engineering degree would allow me to do it all. With an education in practical or applied science and the ability to think creatively, solve problems, and work in teams, I could enter the world with the skill set to tackle any problem. Engineers are the key to the future not only because they have knowledge to develop new technology and ideas, but because they also utilize their expertise in personal skills, efficiency, business, and more to make solutions a reality. Participating in the science fair has convinced me that ‘engineers’ are not always sitting in dark rooms typing code- they are out in the field making a real difference. Engineers are supplying clean water to the impoverished, making the transition to renewable energy, and increasing data security. They are even finding ways to provide girls in third world countries with reusable sanitary products so they can attend school, which is a current issue I have been engaged in with a school club. The world needs engineers working in labs, teaching at universities, directing aid programs, and even serving in the government and international relations. As an engineer, I could be anything.  
","One Friday night during eighth grade, a friend and I volunteered at our elementary school’s science night meant to get the students excited about science. Upon arrival, volunteers were running several stations and demonstrations around the cafeteria, and an enthusiastic director steered us towards a table in the corner. Unaware that we had never assembled a five-foot-tall geodesic dome out of newspaper tubes before, she left us with a packet of obscure diagrams and a salute good luck. Faced with hyper second-graders having newspaper-tube swordfights, my friend and I took the lead. We quickly studied the diagrams and experimented with different ways to arrange the tubes into triangles, secure them with tape, and build the ten-sided base. Eager students rolled the paper into tubes and labeled them with colorful markers while parents helped them attach the tubes to the dome. Meanwhile, my friend and I dashed around, explaining the process to newcomers and distributing copies of the instructions. The dome slowly took shape, but the uneven tubes sagged inwards and hopes for a successful shape before the night ended were slim. Yet, with the help of students and parents holding it up from all sides and several more hands armed with masking tape, we secured the joints of the triangles and attach the final pieces to the top. The giant dome surrounded by grateful parent volunteers and awed students climbing inside was a sight to behold. I have a picture of one girl with her arms outstretched in front of the dome, displaying both its size and her face’s excitement. The experience was an important lesson about being thrown into an unknown situation with only a few instructions and finding a way to create something amazing out of newspaper, some engineering principles, and a group of strangers working together.
","Thinking about my future has helped me hone in on my core passions, and I would like to attend the C-Tech² program to further deepen my understanding of these interests. In school, I find I am most motivated while studying for STEM classes and love to volunteer and participate in service clubs where I am making a difference. Also, I am happiest when working with my hands. In the science fair for the past two years, working with soil and building a rainfall-simulating model to study erosion has helped me discover a newfound love of building and working through setbacks in the design process. I am organized, enjoy working on projects with diverse people, and appreciate the value of cooperation. In group projects at school, I often find myself taking initiative in an absence of leadership while also mediating between opposing personalities and ideas. Above all, I am an adventurous and adaptable person, and C-Tech² is the perfect exploratory program for me to leave my comfort zone, dive into a brand-new experience, and learn more about myself and my future in engineering. I believe my personality can be an asset to the program, but I also know there is so much to gain from C-Tech² in return. I am interested in living on a college campus, exploring the labs and facilities offered by Virginia Tech, learning about science and technology, and widening my teamwork experience with girls with similar focuses. I spend the entire school year confined to a classroom, so I am drawn to this summer experience to work hands-on, discover what engineering students are working on, meet inspiring people, and be exposed to the vast array of engineering fields. Overall, I am genuinely curious and hope to immerse myself in the engineering environment and discover where I can apply these skills into the real world.

However, I had never seriously entertained the idea of becoming an engineer. I saw engineers as men who used a lot of math to build things. My parents constantly told me that I could become anything, and no one ever told me that girls couldn’t be engineers, but no one encouraged me to pursue engineering either. When I heard stories about engineers having a ‘talent’ for building things during their childhood, I believed that I wasn’t cut out for it because I didn’t build/fix things as a child. Without having much of a choice, I was given Barbie dolls to play with, not Lego sets, and when something had to be fixed in my house, my brother was always told to do it.

Although I excelled in math and science, the words ‘mathematician’, ‘scientist’, and ‘engineer’ felt heavy on my tongue; I constantly second-guessed myself. It was only after a year or two into high school that I decided to consider engineering. I don’t want to be an engineer because I believe that I’ve had a natural, preordained path for engineering since I was a toddler. I’ve always had the curiosity, creativity, and the interest in science, and I want to actually pursue engineering because it took many years for me to establish unwavering confidence in my interests and abilities. I think that when a person really wants to pursue something, they don’t ever relinquish it. I don’t know what kind of engineer I want to be, but no matter what specialty I choose, I know I will be able to do things that are important to the world. Although there will be different tasks along the way, I want to eventually contribute to finding solutions to global problems and social injustices, such as access to clean water, diseases, clean energy, pollution, and many others.","Every year, my school holds weekly Assemblies in the auditorium pertaining to certain issues and events that are relevant to the community. As part of the Hispanic/Latino Alliance club, seven members and I had signed up to organize the Latino Heritage Month assembly in October. The club was new, and one week before the assembly, hardly any work had been accomplished. The club leaders were not communicating consistently with all the members, only the introductory speech had been fully written, and most of the members were unsure of their roles. I stepped up to help move things along-- first, I spent significant time scheduling a meeting during a time when everyone would be able to attend. At this meeting, I made sure that every person knew what they had to do, and helped anyone who was struggling with writing their speech. There were disagreements about the perspectives that certain topics would be presented from, but I reminded everyone that that was okay. The purpose of the assembly wasn’t to present everything in only one way; multiple experiences and perspectives were important.

Now that we were making progress, I created a Google Doc and shared it with all the members, so that we could help each other get organized. The document would contain an outline of the assembly, all the speeches and videos that would be presented, and every person’s role. During the next couple of days after the meeting, I sent emails thanking everyone and reminding them of the deadline to send in speeches. The assembly went according to plan, even though it was pulled together in just one week. Since everyone had been diligent with respect to communication and fulfilling their individual parts, the assembly was a success.","In elementary school, I was the type of student who always got top grades. I basked in the glory of gold stars and praises during parent-teacher conferences, while frowning at any ‘satisfactory’ grades. Those were times when I simply did what I was told and I excelled in all subjects. Although I maintained my honor grades in middle school, I often felt tired and bored. It wasn't until I began the 9th grade at a private school for the first time, that I realized I had felt I hadn’t been challenged enough. All of a sudden I was in a school environment that was constantly challenging me to learn more and reach my fullest potential. 

My enjoyment of challenges and my dedication to trying my best are some of the reasons why I would be a great fit for this program. My family immigrated from the Dominican Republic when I was 3 years old, and although it does not appear relevant at first, it is a major reason why I’m a dedicated and diligent person. I’m immensely proud of my parents and I feel it's a personal obligation of mine to make them proud in return by taking advantage of the opportunities that are a result of their sacrifices. I’ve been privileged to have so many great opportunities-- attending programs for high-achieving students, entering an elite private high school, receiving a full scholarship for a summer language program in France-- and I’ve taken full advantage of all of these. I do my best wherever I go, and I know that if selected for C-Tech2, I will learn as much as I can and utilize all the resources that the program provides.

Lastly, I enjoy learning about science, math and technology, and I’ve had a multitude of positive experiences with these subjects in school. I know how to work individually, and from the various science fair projects I’ve done with partners, I also know how to work and collaborate in a team. Since I also like problem-solving and incorporating it into hands-on projects, C-Tech2 would be an overall enriching experience for me.","By checking this box, I am electronically signing this online application and acknowledging that the information I have provided is accurate to the best of my knowledge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tissue engineering enables scientists to create organs and limbs in a laboratory from a single cell. At present, researchers are having difficulty duplicating cells without turning them into a tumor or cancer. I want to help discover a way to overcome this problem so that we can create organs and limbs to save and improve lives. My mom suffers from asthma. It would help her if we could grow lung airway tissues that are less susceptible to inflammation. I am also fascinated with the scientific work of developing vaccines.  For instance, researchers at The University of Minnesota successfully grew the polio virus from HeLa cells, and from there came the creation of the polio vaccine. A career in biomedical engineering would allow me to develop biocompatible prostheses devices. Advances in these devices helps improve the lives of physically challenged people, especially my uncle and our wounded soldiers.   I would like to discover a way to make these prostheses from organic tissues that respond to brain commands.   They can be installed permanently so that people would not have to go to the difficult chore of attaching them.	
As an active volunteer in my community I have become sensitive to environmental issues. As an engineer, I can help reduce wastes that accumulate in landfills and help alleviate environmental pollutants by creating biodegradable products. 
","  I participate in numerous after school activities. These involve many projects that help my community. I have earned many awards for school and community services. An ongoing project that I am proud of is working together with other volunteers to clean up the environment. I am proud to be part of this because so many people come out to help regardless of the weather conditions.  Often we manage to pick up over 300 pounds of trash that would otherwise find its way into sensitive ecosystems. Keeping the waterways and environment clean makes a positive impact on our quality of life and that of future generations. Another ongoing project that I am proud of is serving meals to the homeless.  I and other volunteers have to work as a team to keep things running smoothly when feeding hundreds of people.   In addition to working with other experienced volunteers, I mentor new volunteers and suggest ways to make our work more efficient. When I finish my assigned tasks, I enjoy helping other volunteers with their jobs.","When I was younger I wanted to become a medical doctor to help people. Since then I have developed a fascination for how things work and a desire to learn about the world around me. I am undecided between becoming a doctor or an engineer. After reading about the CTech2 program and comments from CTech2 participants, I am confident that the program can help me decide if engineering is the right career path for me.  I am an honest, responsible, energetic, and caring individual.  I have great compassion for my fellow citizens and love to work to help improve the environment. On a personal note, my parents were divorced when I was one year old, and I was raised with two brothers by my single mother. My mom immigrated to America when she was 25 years old and got married soon afterward.  She has to work multiple jobs to support our family and will not be able to afford the fees for this program.  I am hoping that I will receive a scholarship to attend.","By checking this box, I am electronically signing this online application and acknowledging that the information I have provided is accurate to the best of my knowledge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When I was in elementary school, a teacher told my mother that I was future engineer.  Ever since the, I have been intrigued by engineering, especially since there are so many fields of engineering.  Climate change is creating stronger storms and sea level is rising.  Since human settlements are usually along rivers and coastlines, this means that infrastructure will be damaged if is not strengthen.  Cities need a reliable water and sewer system, electricity, telecommunications, and transportation and these will all be damaged by severe storms.  Rising sea level will damage ports and the subterranean infrastructure of coastal cities.  These are all challenges for engineers.  Existing infrastructure is very old and with new technology we can create more efficient and resilient systems.  I love math and I find the challenge of applying it to real world problems exciting.","A friend needed to manage a community service project in order to become an Eagle Scout.  His project was to mange a group of volunteers who would build a footbridge in a public park.  The bridge had to accommodate the weight and size of an All Terrain Vehicle.  A group of five friends, including me, volunteered for the project.  I looked at bridges in other parks for design styles and settled on a beam bridge because it was simple and economical.   I searched online and found websites and YouTube videos with instructions for building a beam footbridge.  We chose a design and estimated the size and amount of lumber and hardware. Parents used a power saw to cut the wood and a small bucket excavator to dig out a flat area for the footings.  We weren’t allowed to anchor the bridge concrete so we used 4x4 beams at the ends of the bridge as the footings.   We made sure that they were level and stable.  Then we built the deck using 2x4 pressure treated lumber that was nailed on the bottom to cross beams that were used for reinforcement and stability.  When the deck was completed we nailed it to the footings. ","I should be selected for this program based upon my excellent math, spatial, and organizational skills.  Also, I work well in groups.  I always prepare for meetings by doing research so that I have good ideas to contribute.  I do not get disappointed if my ideas aren’t selected, and I enthusiastically work on the chosen idea.

Ever since I was young, I grew up in a household and family where everyone pursued a career either in medicine, customer service, or computer and technological sciences. Early exposure to those specific professions led me to gain an interest and understanding for the requirements and responsibility for all of them. In addition to career exposure outside of school, in school the math and science subjects are where I excel the most. I feel comfortable in those classes because I am confident in my ability to retain that type of information. Volunteer work and projects like science fair and the Future Community and Career Leaders of America competitions allowed me to develop a greater love for self motivated studies and experience even outside the classroom. My many interests make it difficult when I am asked about my favorite class or hobby; however, I am grateful it will play a role in my desire to pursue such a diverse and interesting career, in engineering. Even though I do not know the exact engineering field I want to go into, it is a relief to know that I have many options to choose from, where I can apply my love and knowledge in many subjects.","Last month, I participated in Moody's Mega Math Challenge, which is a national math modeling competition for upperclassmen in high school. Each school can only enroll up to two teams, each consisting of three to five people. I volunteered to participate and was eventually chosen along with three other juniors to be on the second team to represent our school. Teams are allotted 14 hours, once they have logged in, to complete the real-life problem at hand. Along with using the resources provided by the program, we used other computing devices, for example, graphing calculators, Microsoft Excel, and the Math Lab Software in order to solve the challenge. All the team members met at my house at seven o’clock on a chilly Saturday morning. After eating a energy filled breakfast we got to work. Spending that much time in a mostly enclosed environment with few breaks can lead many to grow frustrated. However, our friendship outside the competition allowed us to be patient, understanding, and reach consensus faster and easier with each other throughout the entire process. We were able to finish early in fact, submitting our paper around seven o’clock in the evening. This competition was by no means mandatory but, my teammates and I’s desire to gain experience outside the classroom motivated us to participate, and was also a great factor in our combined success. ","As one of the highest academic achievers in my grade, the success and the academic dedication I posses is far above the average student. In addition to academics, I am a hardworking high school student with an athletic and service based experience. I am able to manage busy schedules, and still complete responsibilities in a timely and high quality fashion. Additionally, I have leadership experience with small children, older adults and all ages in between. I am also trilingual, allowing me to communicate with various different people. All those qualities and characteristics I have made me well rounded and would allow me to be an asset. Contrary to the previously mentioned strengths, as an immigrant, I grew up unable to speak English well, which greatly inhibited me from succeeding in school. I was in the English for speakers of other Languages program for many years and it was through my tenacity that I was able to test out. I have firsthand experience being a minority and underdog, which is still how women are viewed in most STEM related fields, especially engineering. Now, as a female, who excels in those subjects and has a strong passion not only for STEM but also to dispel that negative stigma surrounding women, especially women of color, in science and math based careers, I think I would be a strong candidate for this program.","By checking this box, I am electronically signing this online application and acknowledging that the information I have provided is accurate to the best of my knowledge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I really want to be able to come up with new things to help people and make their future a brighter one.  This is what being in the engineering field would help me to be able to accomplish.  I also wanted to be engineer because I love to build things and come up with ways to improve different tools or things in the world.  Like I want to build prosthetic by doing this you have to be able to have fun putting things together and improving the old things to make them better for people.  I also really want to do engineering because I really like math and numbers which I use math to keep me calm on the soccer field.  So I want to do something that involves math, building things and helping people which is what engineering is to me.   This also because I could help save people from different major global issues like I could help with water crisis in Africa so they could have clean water and be able to live a better life.  We also we are always needing engineers for some why not I do something that involves so many things that I like to do in life.   So I want to something I love to do which is build things, help people, and do math. ",I work on many teams to solve problems.  One time that I did this was at Big Brothers and Big Sisters with the kid which I have been helping the past two years.  My little has been struggling with reading and math the past two years.  So we have had to work together to improve him and get him to understand things better.  We had to have him reading multiple books to get to improve but sometimes there was the struggle of getting him to read because he doesn't like to that much.  So we tried choosing books that would interest him.  So he really liked superheros so we went and found books that where about superheros like the one book had how every marvel superhero was started.  We over came the  problem or challenge of getting him to read and understand the books.  So know his reading has improved some and is still improving.  He also become more interested in reading than ever before.  While the math side was he is not getting addition and subtraction.  We had some how get him to understand subtraction with smaller numbers and bigger numbers.  So with the smaller numbers we tried to use our fingers and then in the end he has started to memorize the different factors.  Then with the bigger numbers we told him to beak them down into the smaller problems and then he could do them.  Another problem came with this was frustrating when he got problems wrong and him saying this like I can't do this it is to hard.  So I worked on teach him along with his teach that he can do anything he just has to believe he can.  Actually has he has been putting the ways to solve the problems along with belief that he can had caused this to increase his knowledge in addition and subtraction.  The goal though we have for the end of the year to get to be able to multiplication and division but it will be another challenge or problem that we will face along the way. ,I feel I should be selected for this program for many reasons.  The first would because I love math and I have want to go into the field biomedical engineering since the beginning of 7th grade which is the fall 2013.  It would also be great to go to the program before my junior year but if I don't get to I will apply to go to the program my senior year. I feel it will be great think if I can go to a program now and see other different things that could help me with a lot of different things like college choices and other things like what goes into an engineering job that someone would do everyday.  Also see the other different degrees you could get in engineering other than Biomedical Engineering.  The program will help me with learning new and different things that I probably don't know about engineering which will be fun.  I really like to learn new things when it comes to something that I love to do.  Which makes me want to get better at the different things involved in engineering which is the opportunity that this program gives to me.  This program gives me the opportunity to also cause my dreams and be around other females which work in the engineering and other females my age that want to become future engineers of the world so we can share are passions together and grow friendships with people that have the same interests as I do. ,"By checking this box, I am electronically signing this online application and acknowledging that the information I have provided is accurate to the best of my knowledge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For our first trial, our group decided upon a container filled to the brim with cotton balls. During the testing, we found that our egg did not survive the drop.

We had to take a step back and look at what was happening to the egg as it was dropped. We looked at the momentum the egg would gain from the drop and the impact the structure would face. After some research, we found a substance that was vicious enough to slow down the egg and also have a strong exterior to protect the egg from the impact. A jar of peanut butter. It seemed unconventional but it resulted in an intact egg after the drop.","I would like to be selected for CTech2  because I believe I’m just on the cusp of discovering my potential and I’m excited to explore all that might be available to me in college.

Engineering can offer solutions to many of the world’s problems, such as energy efficiency. I am passionate about the environment; nature is beautiful, and we must protect it.  We can conserve resources and preserve ecosystems by engineering new clean, renewable energy sources. Solutions already exist; people can use solar power or wind to generate electricity, and there are electric and solar powered cars. However, these solutions are still comparably more expensive than the less clean, nonrenewable fossil fuels. We must find a way to decrease the cost and increase efficiency of clean, renewable resources for them to become more popular and successfully replace fossil fuels. If I became an engineer, I would have the knowledge to contribute my own solution to this problem.","In Robotics, a few other girls and I were tasked with designing the bumpers for the robot. These were to be made of pool noodles attached to wooden boards, with red or blue fabric wrapped around them. We needed to have both red and blue bumpers for the competition, which we would exchange based on what team we were on for a specific round. Instead of making two sets of bumpers, we covered the set with red fabric and made bumper sleeves out of blue fabric, which we could quickly slip on and fasten with Velcro. This task seemed simple, but it was much more complicated and time-consuming than we expected. The most difficult part was getting the bumpers to fit together on the robot. We could not change the layout of the robot, so we drilled holes and attached brackets to the bumpers in such a way that we could attach them to the robot without removing bolts already in place. Countless times, the brackets were slightly off, or the bumpers slightly too long to fit properly. In addition, as we were almost finishing, the people working on the robot adjusted its frame, making its perimeter considerably smaller. This completely threw off our measurements, and we had to adjust all over again. However, we eventually succeeded in making the bumpers fully functional and easy to remove.","I should be selected for this program because I am hardworking, and eager to learn and make the best out of it. I hope that this program will draw me in and make me even more excited about STEM. I am looking forward to learning more about the real-world applications engineering has to offer. Although I know that math, science, and problem-solving interest me, and that engineering combines these things, I feel as if I have only a vague idea of what engineering truly is. If I have more experience with it, I will be able to know for sure that it is something I want to pursue in college and later in life. This program would give me the hands-on experience I feel I need to confirm that engineering is the right choice for me.

",,"I have always enjoyed math and science the most, so pursuing a career in STEM always seemed like the right choice for me. However, research has never been my forte, as I much prefer problem solving working hands-on. I love the rush I get whenever I solve a difficult math problem and love applying what I have already learned to solve unfamiliar problems. For example, I recall being particularly excited at the beginning of an electrostatics unit in physics when presented with a combination of a forces problem and new equation, Coulomb’s law. I see math and science everywhere in my life. Since I started taking physics, my interest in STEM has only grown: it excites me to calculate such things as a how fast I would be going if I skied down a hill of a particular height. I want to be an engineer so that I can combine my passion for math and science with my love of problem solving.","One day my physics class did an activity in which each lab group had to, using only three pieces of paper and a limited length of tape, create a contraption that would hold an egg and protect it from cracking when dropped from one meter above the floor. I worked with three other girls in my class. From our knowledge of impact and momentum, we figured out that to reduce the force on the egg when it hit the floor we had to increase the time of the collision. So, we decided that we would need as much paper as possible in between the egg and where the contraption hit the floor. I suggested that we roll up a tube of one of the sheets of paper and put the egg in the middle so if the paper hit the floor vertically the tube would crumple and not the egg. We decided to make that the main shape of our contraption, but we needed to do more. What if the contraption flipped on its side? If that happened, the egg would have less than a millimeter of paper between it and the floor. So, one of my teammates rolled up another piece of paper and wrapped it around the center of the first tube. We then did the same thing with the third piece of paper, and our plan was taking shape. Now, we had to figure out how to get the egg in and out so we could check on it after the first drop, and ensure that the egg did not slide out of the contraption when it hit the floor. We decided to split the tape into thinner pieces so we would have more length to work with. We taped the egg to the corner of the first sheet of paper then rolled it up diagonally to increase the length of the tube. Then, we put tape on the egg from inside the tube. We decided that it was not enough, so we ripped a piece off of each of the other two sheets of paper and crumpled them up to go in the tube on either side of the egg. Lastly, we wrapping and taped the remaining paper around the center of the tube. Our egg was now very securely inside the contraption, and we were ready for our first test. (It survived.)","I am a great candidate for this program because I am hardworking, passionate about STEM, and interested in becoming an engineer.  I know I will put a lot of effort into all of the daily activities and design project, so I would get a lot out of it and will greatly enjoy both the educational and recreational aspects of the program.  This program would really help me because I hope to get an idea of which type of engineering interests me the most, and which major I would like to pursue. Out of all of the options out there, I am having trouble deciding what to pick. Furthermore, I am fun to be around and like to meet new people, so I will try to contribute to making the program an enjoyable experience for everybody else there. Lastly, I adore Virginia Tech—the campus is so beautiful and the students all seem so friendly and spirited. Thank you so much for considering me for this program.","By checking this box, I am electronically signing this online application and acknowledging that the information I have provided is accurate to the best of my knowledge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the future I would like to go to college and major in computer science because I love programming. I enjoy using math and logic to solve problems. Last year I was in programming and this year I am taking computer science in school. There is such a great feeling of accomplishment that you get when you complete an algorithm that returns the outcome you set out to produce. When the program compiles and no longer pops up a dozen error messages that make no sense, until you actually look back at the program and see that you spelled “for” with an uppercase “F”.  In the future I want to be able to continue doing that type of work. I want to have problems that I can fix and program solutions for. Another reason I want to become an engineer is because there are not enough women in tech. Tech is an excellent job field to go into now and many girls choose different job paths. Last year in my programming class there were only 5 girls and 26 boys and this year in my computer science class there are only 7 girls and 21 boys. Many girls are choosing not to learn this very valuable skill and it's a tragedy. This field is never going to balance out and is forever going to stay male dominated if females don't start realizing the rich job market for tech and start going into the field. I would really like to contribute to helping balance out the women in tech fields and encourage other girls to do the same. These are just some of the numerous reasons why being an engineer appeals to me.","My science fair project was a team project. For my science fair project I worked with a partner to program different algorithms to shorten the runtime of shortest route programming. We based our science fair project off of the traveling salesman problem, which involves trying to find the shortest route through multiple different points. To do this we programmed three different algorithms that tried to find the shortest route in the most effective way. The first algorithm was called “Brute Force,” which completed all possible routes. The second algorithm that we created was called “Early Exit,” which was based off of brute force. The algorithm would get rid of routes prematurely, so if the route is longer than previous routes before it is completed then it would get rid of it. So in this algorithm we were able to complete fewer routes while still finding the shortest route. Our last route was called Next Closest Point which started on one node and then went to its closest neighbor until it finished one route and then moved on to the next starting point. This algorithm would have the same number of routes as the select number of nodes we picked to be in the program, because each node would be a starting point. Our team science fair project won second place in mathematics at the regional science fair. We were a great team because we divided up the work so we would be more efficient and be able to better express our strengths through our work. I was good at programing, so I mostly did the algorithms for the project. My partner was very good at public speaking and presenting things in terms the audience would understand, so she was a big help in presenting our project to our class and to the judges at the school science fair. When we got to the regional fair, I did more of the actual explaining of the algorithms because we were presenting our to judges that actually worked in the field of computer science who understood more complex explanations.","I should be selected for this program because I want to create things. I want to make things faster, safer, and more energy efficient. I love computer science and I believe one day I could go into this field and create things that will help society. I enjoy doing art and building and I want to incorporate that creativity into my algorithms, finding new ways to complete projects and look outside of the box. I should also be selected for this program because I have taken both a programming course and a computer science course and, have not only gotten an A in one and am getting an A in the other, but I am generally the fastest at solving the problems we are given and am asked to help others that are struggling. I am also in the process of learning Java and I have been introduced to/ know some of: Python, Visual Basic and HTML. I won second place in the Fairfax County Regional Science Fair in the mathematics category with a team programming project, described above. I am also involved in Girls Who Code as an extracurricular activity at my school. I would really like to expand my knowledge in the engineering field, another reason why I should be selected for this program.","By checking this box, I am electronically signing this online application and acknowledging that the information I have provided is accurate to the best of my knowledge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We do all of the behind-the-scenes work for every show done in our theater. Also, after my first year in the class, once I had passed every test and became a licensed technician, I started working for the school and now get paid for teching events in the theater. ",11th,"Technical Theater, Sept 2015-present (we do most of the work from this program after school so it is an extracurricular as well as a class)","Assistant Stage Manager, Theater Department, Oct-Nov 2016","Honor Roll Student, South Lakes Academics, 2016","Technical Theater, 2015-present","JV Girls Basketball Team Manager, 2015-2016; International Thespians Society, 2016-present",,"I want to be an engineer because it is the most obvious path for me. I have always had kind of a knack for math and science and I always enjoyed them as well. Not many things have really caught my attention as much as engineering has, and I didn’t excel as well in other areas that caught my attention and they became more like hobbies. Like theater for example, I used to want to act and sing and be on stage, but after being rejected from my middle school musical and being put on the sound crew instead showed me the wonders of the technical world and how there is more magic going on backstage than onstage. The same thing happened with basketball. I was never really that good on the court, but then I found the technical aspects, keeping book and controlling the scoreboard, that could keep me involved while still being in a position that I can excel in. My hobbies also have showed me how prominent technology and engineering is in everything nowadays. From theater to sports to cooking, everything uses technology, so being an engineer is a very versatile job and even if you want to work in another field, you can still be an engineer. Because of this, I can still stay close to something I am passionate about, theater, and still do what I’m good at, engineering. My dad always tells me that the best bachelors degree that you can get is in Engineering because technology is everywhere. So even if you want to be a doctor, lawyer, actor, chef, politician, or anything else, an engineering degree can help you to understand that aspect of your job. It is almost impossible to be successful in today’s world without knowledge of technology, so I want learn as much as possible to be successful in today’s and tomorrow’s world.","In technical theater, we are always working together as a team. The entire class comes to every build day while we are building the set for the show, then everyone comes to the tech and dresses and the the shows, so I work in a team for most of what I do. During build, we often work together to build components of the set; we also help each other by running to the back room to grab something for someone or we will spot each other on the ladder or hydraulic lift. We often have to solve the problem of how do we get this flat up the second floor or how can we make it appear that there is a roof on this house without having to put an actual roof on the house? We have to work together to solve problems during a show as well. Once, during our fall show, Noises Off, an actor was carrying prop glass bottle on stage and dropped it and we had to figure out how to work some mops and brooms into the scene so the actors could clean up the mess a bit as soon as possible, and luckily intermission was soon after the accident and I had the chance to go out and sweep and mop the stage before we moved all the set, props, and furniture into place for the next act. Fortunately, that show was meant to be very messy, there was constant high jinks and shenanigans so the bottle breaking in the middle of a scene was not too out of place and the actors and tech played it off well, as if it was supposed to happen. Another time, while working on that same show, an actor cut his hand on the top of a bottle during a tech and dress, and some of us fast thinking techs ran to grab some damp paper towels and the first aid kit to patch up the actor, while other techs ran to grab mops to clean up the little blood that had gotten on the floor. Situations like that can happen at any time, and being techs, we are always prepared for the worst and always know how to work together to solve our problem when the worst comes our way. ","I should be selected for this program because, right now, I am interested in technology and engineering, but a program like this can show me the really fun parts of engineering that I may not have been exposed to yet. I am have mostly been involvement in engineering has been in technical theater so my knowledge of engineering is not quite as extensive and well-rounded as I hope it could be someday, but I know I could be introduced and learn about many areas of technology that could entice me and I may want to follow a path there. I am also always ready to make friends that are interested in the same fields as I am, and currently most of my friends are from theater because of that, but it could be very cool to make some friends that are more involved in engineering and that could help me on my journey to find what I am truly passionate about and what I would like to continue into in college and beyond. I also have a good connection to Virginia Tech. I have a cousin who went there and another cousin who is currently attending, my camp counselor that I became very close with is also currently attending, and both of my older siblings seriously considered Virginia Tech for college, my brother ended up taking a different path and my sister, unfortunately did not get in but probably would have gone if she had. I also visited the campus this past February for the International Thespians Society Conference and I got to learn about the theatrical options at Virginia Tech. The campus itself was also very beautiful. It had this very classic look that I loved and I wanted to spend more time there, and with this program I can and I can see the inner workings of the engineering school and get a glimpse into college life at Virginia Tech. I have already been interested in applying Virginia Tech for college next year, but a program like this could really sell me on wanting to go there once I graduate.","By checking this box, I am electronically signing this online application and acknowledging that the information I have provided is accurate to the best of my knowledge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

	My first choice of extracurricular activities where sports in the form of basketball and baseball I enjoyed these activities but my mind and my heart lite up the summer after I completed 3rd grade.  That summer I participated in an introduction to Engineering Camp w/ my NSBE advisor Helen Howell in addition to participating in a small lego Robotics camp with one of my current high school Robotics coach’s Mark Toole.  My mind raced with anticipation as I learned to build things out of so many different materials I was amazed to see what everyday things like empty water bottles and card board could be used to create different forms of technology.
	As I approached middle school I was positive I wanted to do something dealing with technology and engineering as a career.

As a kid, I enjoyed my dad’s math lessons where I learned to solve difficult problems mentally. Now, I actively participate in my calculus class, due to my passion for mathematics. As my fascination escalated, my parents took me to multiple STEM fairs. I distinctly remember a physicist from a research booth, who placed the beak of a plastic eagle on my finger. Surprisingly, it was perfectly balanced; to me, this was magic, magic that I aspired to create someday. This moment, although small, sparked a deep desire for creating. I participated in many extracurricular activities to increase my knowledge and skill set. My proclivity to morph designs into fully functional devices worked in favor of my robotics team. I appreciated the meticulous characteristic of the design process and applied it in many scenarios including robotics: I recognized the problem, mentally developed a solution, and designed until my product was operable on PTC Creo. Finally, the last two stages, building and testing, required patience and persistence. Even after refining the soft copy of the design, problems like traction still needed a solution. Due to my constant interest, I developed the idea to use cupboard liner as a grip on the threads of our robot. To me, engineering is understanding the fundamental principles and using imagination to solve practical problems; it’s the process that turns dreams into reality using the power of math. Manoj Bhargava, creator of 5-hour energy, owns an experiment-based company. One of his projects included a stationary bicycle that generates and stores energy as it is used. This promotes a healthy lifestyle and clean energy. Similarly, I desire to engineer one innovation for two solutions, making change a rapid and more affordable process. My eagerness to prove the power of women in engineering grows stronger along with my motivation to give back to the world through my passion.","As a participant of robotics, I worked with my teammates to form the optimal FIRST Robotics Team. My first day of FTC I was open to working and building in teams, but I had never used real tools or designed on a 3-D software. With the help of my teammates, I have overcome these adversities. Our efforts at previous competitions had faltered on the path to success. A week prior to our next competition, the coaches and a few members were on the verge of quitting. However, I believed that we had a strong foundation and just needed a simple strategy. I convinced the team to refocus our aim in limiting the size of our robot and construct parts that serve a dual purpose. While watching the construction outside, I observed a crane moving the dirt and its ability to revolve around the main driving component. Immediately, I recalled the design for an Omni-arm. The following meeting, I presented a rough sketch for an arm and the team refined the design. For example, a member suggested that the gear ratio be 3:1 to increase the torque. The arm was heavy, so we constructed the upper portion using single plated pieces and implemented a linked gear system to give the servo more power. Afterwards, we allocated tasks to specialized members; my role was to fabricate the design on PTC Creo. As we assembled the robot, the programmer configured the motors based on the soft copy. For planning purposes, we met periodically to assign existing tasks to those who finished their part. We decorated our poster and wrote our scripts for the judge’s presentation. Due to our team work, motivation, and capability to easily transform an electronic creation into a physical copy, we finished the work within a day’s time. The competition was a great success and we received second place in the preliminary rounds, even as a team of four boys and a girl. Because of our diverse mind and skill sets we formed a successful team, and I was well appreciated for my work on designing the Omni-arm precisely. ","This summer program would provide an opportunity to transform myself into a diverse engineer and enable me with the knowledge to decipher which field of engineering to pursue. As a junior, I greatly value the opportunity to communicate with college students, especially female students at Virginia Tech. Not only will I be able to speak with the student engineers, but I will also be able to experience college lectures taught by the excellent faculty. Recently, I have watched Dr. Wu Feng’s Computer Science talk from 2009, and I was amazed by how easily he is able to relate complicated topics to everyday subjects for girls my age. I would benefit tremendously by receiving the opportunity to attend C-Tech^2. I would also contribute to the program in many ways. As a member of many team activities like Marching Band, Science Olympiad, robotics, and dance, I have learned how to work well in teams and can convey my ideas to those of a different mindset. Peer learning is a very important component of learning within the C-Tech^2 community as well as diversity. I hope to take part in such an environment and I have the proper communication skills. I have a background in working as a counselor for many STEM camps and have experience in a few different forms of engineering, so I will be able to aid my peers in reaching their full potential, through this program. I know that one of the initial goals of C-Tech^2 is to accept girls of varying ethnic and educational backgrounds to emphasize on the concept that we should help one another reach our goals. Being good at math, I will be able to help other participants understand concepts. At my school, I am a peer tutor for all math below the level of Calculus AB and I have become a patient and efficient teacher in the process. If given the chance to attend this engineering program, I will be able to unleash my full potential and contribute to the program by helping others reach their ambitions as well.","By checking this box, I am electronically signing this online application and acknowledging that the information I have provided is accurate to the best of my knowledge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Coventry Sailfish Swim Team is a summer swim team. In addition to swimming for them, I help teach children ages 8 and younger how to swim. 

Butterfly House Docent for Norfolk Botanical Gardens- Norfolk, Virginia
This is a volunteer program in which I teach people visiting the butterfly house about the butterflies and moths in the house. ","I want to be an engineer because I love to problem solve, create, and aid others. I participated in many engineering programs which made me want to pursue a career in the field.  
Throughout my life, my pastimes have involved problem solving. I participated in the Technology Student Association (TSA), Mu Alpha Theta, and Beta Club. Through these clubs, I used my problem-solving capabilities to solve complex math problems, create packaging to protect fragile items, and design efficient bridges. The use of problem solving in engineering has given me a desire to use this skill in future career choices.
I love to create. I have participated in many engineering classes. Through them, I have created rockets, dragsters, roller coaster prototypes, programmed robots, and much more. My favorite project was creating a dragster. I liked using creativity to design a vehicle that was as light and aerodynamic as possible. I found it fascinating to learn the different forces that act on the dragster, and then to create a dragster that would balance these forces to go as fast as possible. 
One of my goals is to be involved in a career that helps others. I believe that engineering will help me achieve this. As a military kid, I have lived in many places both overseas and in the US. I have seen many beautifully engineered skyscrapers, cities, cars, and other creations. I believe that engineering is used to create a world that is safer, more efficient, and more aesthetically pleasing. Through engineering, I can use my skills and interests to aid others. 
My experiences in engineering showed me that I have an interest in the field. Through engineering clubs, I learned the value of problem solving. Due to my experiences with the dragster, I learned the joy of creating. I also learned about the solutions that engineers bring to the world. I want to be an engineer because I can use my aptitude and interest in engineering to aid the world. ","I was involved in the NASA program HUNCH (High School Students United with NASA to Create Hardware). My team’s problem was to create a washing machine that would be used on the International Space Station (ISS). Since it would work in space, this machine would have to operate in microgravity while enduring forces not ordinarily experienced on Earth. 
The first step we took was to divide our team up into several small teams. Each of these smaller teams created a potential design for the machine. These designs were presented to the entire class; we voted on the best design. After a design was chosen, all members thought about possible alterations that could be made to the design to improve it. The design that was chosen was a hand powered machine; it was basically a washboard inside of a box. By the end of the project, the washing machine was greatly altered. First, it was a see-through box with no sharp corners or edges (to prevent injury to the astronauts). Additionally, two holes were made in the side of the box in which two waterproof gloves were put; these gloves were joined to the holes to make the box water tight. Additionally, the box had another hole through which a vacuum or water hose could be placed to either fill or empty the box of water. Lastly, a watertight door was added so the clothes could be put in the machine. 
Being involved in HUNCH taught me a lot about engineering. It taught me how engineers work together to create, how a product is designed, and the logistics of creating a product with specific requirements. It also showed me that engineering requires talents and interests that I have, and that I enjoy using. It was an inspiring experience, and one that furthered my desire to continue to work with engineering.
","I should be selected for this program because I wish to learn more about different types of engineering, I am a dedicated and highly capable student, and I wish to become an engineer.
 I want to learn more about the many different types of engineering. In my science and math classes, I often ask questions about the applications of the material we are learning. For example, I wish to learn more about how math is utilized in the real world, and how physics concepts explain the world around us. I enjoy talking to my parents and grandfather (an electrical engineer) about these questions. This program will allow me to ask and discuss my questions about the many types of engineering. I currently do not have a favorite area of engineering and would like to narrow down my options, so I can choose appropriate college and career paths in upcoming years.
Secondly, I am a very involved and dedicated student. I participate in Mu Alpha Theta (math honor society), Beta Club, and French National Honor Society. I am also on my school’s swimming and soccer teams. In school, I am in the most advanced classes and maintain all A’s. I work hard to do well in everything I am involved in. I am good at balancing many activities, while also doing well in them. I believe this level of commitment and involvement along with my attitude of trying hard to do well in all that I do makes me a good match for this program. 
Lastly, I love Virginia Tech. I went to a college visit for it last year and immediately decided that it was a school I would greatly enjoy going to. I was especially drawn to the engineering program, and I want to learn more about it. C-Tech² would allow me to do that. Because I want to learn more about Virginia Tech’s engineering program, I want to learn more about different types of engineering, and because I am a dedicated, successful and engaged student, I should be selected to C-Tech².

I have always enjoyed math and sciences classes. However, even more so I love the application of these principles to solve problems. I appreciate the process of finding solutions to real world issues. In addition, the tangible results of engineering and how they impact society seems both fulfilling and intriguing to me. I know that engineering would be an excellent career for me because of the challenges it would provide, the intellectual stimulation, and the gratification from helping society.

I was recently exposed to an example of these world-changing ideas in a presentation on one university's plan to work towards becoming carbon neutral. I found these ideas really inspiring because if they can achieve such significant results with the size of their campus, these concepts can be utilized by other communities. Many of the world’s most pressing problems can only be solved by engineering new solutions. Interdisciplinary teams must work together and be creative to develop these answers.  In order for this to work many technical and softer skills are required.  This is why I want to go into engineering. 

I believe the C-Tech2 program would give me the experience I need to further figure out what discipline of engineering I want to focus on. Because I enjoy physics, chemistry, and biology I believe environmental engineering may be the correct path for me. Nevertheless, I cannot be sure of this without more practical experiences outside of my high school classroom. This program would help give me that exposure I need to start solidifying my exact interests in the STEM fields in order to move forward as I finish high school and advance into college.","My interest in engineering is highlighted by two team projects we completed in my IB Physics class where we were tasked to design and build both an accurate golfball launcher and a toothpick bridge. For the first competition, we designed and built a catapult that met the design criteria for our high school.  Because it was the most accurate project at our school, my teacher wanted us to compete at the county competition, Final Frontiers. However, the constraints had changed from those that were used at our school, such as a metal hinge was no longer allowed, so we therefore would have needed to redesign our prototype. Sadly we did not have the time to make these adjustments because of other commitments, so we did not compete. The second competition was to make the lightest toothpick bridge that could hold 4.6 kg over a 40 cm span. Our bridge was the best in our school, so it competed in the county competition were it placed second. If we had more time we could have lightened our design by prototype testing and redesigning in order to eliminate the extra toothpicks on members that did not need to be as strong as they were.

These experiences were a lot of fun because all of my team members had different abilities and perspectives which allowed us to produce two rather unique designs.  Each team member utilized their specific skill-set so we were able to work efficiently as a team. I focused on the design aspect of these projects by utilizing the knowledge I had gained from the mechanical advantage unit and static force unit of my Principles of Engineering class. Other members of the team focused on communication and building the prototypes.  Without each team member fulfilling their roles like they did, we would not have been nearly as successful.  Working on these projects, I learned how having a diversity of experiences and risking new designs can have a large impact on the success of an endeavor. ","I believe that I would be an excellent candidate for this program because of my love of engineering, my desire to learn and to be challenged, and my interest in learning more about engineering at Virginia Tech. I attend the magnet program at Richard Montgomery High School where I partake in an IB Diploma Program. I chose this program as it pushes me to take advanced courses even in subjects that I find more challenging and provides me with valuable skills. Although I find Spanish a very difficult course, I am taking Spanish level 5 this year due to program requirements. Taking Spanish up to this level has taught me to overcome difficulties in areas that are not my strength. In addition, the IB program focuses on developing well-rounded students and stresses communication and reflection skills in these students. I feel the interconnected abilities I have developed from this program will be extremely helpful as I advance further into my engineering interests. Due to my curiosity with math and sciences, I have pushed myself to take the most advanced classes in these subjects. I am currently in multivariable calculus and differential equations after having received a “5” on the AP BC Calculus exam in tenth grade. In addition, I am currently taking IB biology and IB physics, and will take the higher level exam next year in mathematics, biology, and physics subjects to earn my IB diploma. My STEM abilities are also evidenced by my earning a ACT STEM sub-score of 36.

This camp would allow me to continue this journey and learn about the excellent engineering program at Virginia Tech.  I know I have both the technical knowledge and the softer skills that are necessary to be successful in this field. Hence I believe that I would be an asset for team projects.

Summer employment : Acme Markets. 9600 Long Beach Blvd, Beach Haven, NJ.  Worked as casher and bagger.  ","Engineers are known for being some of the brightest and most versatile people in the world.  They have the ability to see a problem and use every aspect of their knowledge to find a solution.  Their problem solving is beyond identifying a few symptoms and referencing a book, engineers require creativity and the ability to apply knowledge of various subjects to serious issues.  When a water pollution develops, Environmental Engineers go out to the scene and figure out the cause and how to clean it up, when a company needs a new machine to mass produce plumbing equipment they contact Mechanical Engineers, or when MAC cosmetics needs a new formula for a lipstick they may ask a Chemical Engineer to develop it.  Engineers are a necessity and offer new and improved ideas in all departments.   

I want to be an engineer because when an issue or problem arises, I want to be able to use what I have learned in geometry and physics class to create a solution or plan for those situations. Everyday when I go to work I want to be presented with a challenging task that will require an extensive amount of work from me each day.  But when I leave, I will walk away with new understandings and ideas that I gained from collaborating and listening to extremely talented professionals.  
","For a final project in my Honors Biology class, my group was assigned a six week biodiversity project that required us to save a dying species. We were assigned the ecosystem of New Zealand and identify the Kiwi bird as a dying species and the effect their decrease had on other species.  Through thorough research, together we found that the majority of Kiwis do not survive long enough to become adults and that it is critical for us to create a solution that will prolong their lifespans’.  As a team we began exchanging ideas and building on topics that stood out.  

At one point a member suggested the idea of creating a reservation and another mentioned the idea of breeding more adult kiwis.  It was those two candidates that stood out as the most realistic and executable, but each strategy could not stand on its own.  So, we began to research current incubating facilities and reservations that were currently in operation to save the bird species.  We found that many of the kiwis bred in incubating facilities did not survive in the wild due to lack of parental help and the inability to adapt to the wild. The birds that were kept in reservations were in a contained area and unable to help the wild kiwis grow their population.  

As a team, we were able to take both ideas and create an incubation-captivity center that will allow breeding of more babies to occur and provide a practical environment that the kiwis can grow up to learn the skills they need in order to survive in the wild.  We hoped that once the kiwis enter adult we would be able to release them to the wild so they can naturally reproduce and stabilize their population.  The project was very extensive for the experience I had at the time and required a lot of collaboration, but it could not have been executed as well as it had been with only my own ideas.
","Engineering is not an individual sport in any aspect whatsoever, engineering requires the exchanging of ideas and the need to bouncing concepts off of others to be able to create and execute a plan in the most ideal manner.  I can not truthfully say that I am the smartest female my age, however one thing I can promise you is that I am one of the best team players I know and have strong leadership skills.  I have grown up in a household of five very out spoken and creative people and all my life I have been participating in various sports that require me to work with a variety of people.  From a young age I was introduced to soccer, cheer, softball and basketball, and currently I am playing year-round volleyball.  All of which require the cooperation and fluidity of everyone in the team to be successful.  

Please note, I do not discount my academics, I take my education very seriously and am a very conscientious student.  I am currently enrolled in 5 advanced placement classes ( AP only available to Juniors at my school )  I also entered high school taking Algebra 2 as a Freshman and have already taken 4 honors level classes before my Junior year.  You will find I have constantly challenged myself academically throughout my three years of highschool, a personal characteristics and drive that has been instilled in me from my years of playing team sports.    

In summary, I believe I am a well rounded student, that not only has a solid background in math and science but more importantly enjoys working and collaborating with my peers to solve a problem.  You might say I have the perfect mix of technical, leadership and people skills.

",,"	I want to be an engineer because engineering is more than just a compilation of facts or knowledge, or the ability to do math or physics or chemistry. Engineering requires that you be capable in these areas, but it also requires that you understand how to apply that information to other disciplines, and solve real world problems. Engineering synthesizes skills and knowledge from across the board and uses that to solve problems which directly pertain to our lives. To me, that is the beauty of engineering. More than any other field it allows us to use our knowledge and creativity to solve problems. Ever since I was a young girl I have loved solving problems. I always enjoyed making puzzles and playing logic games. The feeling of having a challenge, and then using your skills to overcome it never failed to fill me with joy and satisfaction. Putting in the final piece of a puzzle and finally seeing how everything works together just right is a simple feeling, but to me it is the best feeling in the world. I love figuring out the best solution to a problem that is set in front of me, and the feeling of finally seeing it all work out. It is not enough to know the fact, you also have to use your creativity to find the answer. That’s why I want to be an engineer: so that I can use relevant knowledge together with creative skills to find answers to problems and questions that are very real to my life today. ","	One time that I had to work on a team to solve a problem was when we were assigned a lab activity in physics class. In this particular activity, the group had to calculate the velocity and trajectory of a marble as it rolled off a ramp, and place a target on the floor so that the marble would hit in the center of the target. The group had two chances for the marble to hit the target. At first, our group calculated the path of the marble and placed the target on the floor, making sure that the target was perfectly in line with the end of the ramp. However, the marble did not land near the center of the target, in fact, it missed the target completely. Since the marble was so far off we knew that there was something wrong with our calculations, not just the placement of the target. We went back and checked our calculations, each looking at our numbers individually, but still all came up with the same value we had reached the first time. We were certain we had done all the math completely correctly, but we knew that the number couldn’t be true because of how far off the marble had been. Feeling rather stuck, I decided to look over the work from someone else in my group, and have them review my work, in order to see if that would reveal any discrepancies. To my surprise, when I looked at the other persons work I realized something that had previously escaped my mind. Though we had in fact done the math correctly, we had failed to use the correct number when original plugging in values, and had been using a positive value of velocity, rather than a negative one. It was a simple mistake, and once we fixed that it was correct on the next try, but if I hadn’t been able to look at the problem from someone else’s perspective, I could have been stumped by that for hours. When you’re working on a problem, having additional perspectives can be immeasurably beneficial to overcoming obstacles, which is why it is always valuable to work in a team, rather than do everything alone.","	I believe that I should be selected to this program for many reasons. First, my academic success which is shown in my previous grades and current course load demonstrates my intellectual strength. This strength is paramount to a program such as this one, which requires strong math and science skills. This strength will also allow me to have future success in the field of engineering. Additionally, my academic success reveals my dedicated work ethic. I have always worked hard in every class and extracurricular which I have participated in, and have always gotten results from this hard work. It is extremely important to me to be able to dedicate myself to getting results, and this same attitude will be applied to my time at this program. I will certainly be committed to trying my hardest and learning the most through this experience. Secondly, I am able to do more than just memorize facts. I am also very able to find creative solutions to problems and questions. The ability to generate innovative solutions is vital to engineering, and I believe that I have the skills necessary to adequately fill this requirement of originality and innovation. Lastly, I should be chosen for this program because I have a genuine interest in the field of engineering. I plan to major in engineering when I enter college, and this program will give me the foundation that I will need to be successful in engineering, and will also help me figure out more about the field in general, and about what different things I could do with an engineering degree once I leave college.

Camp Community College of Franklin: I worked with many children to help build upon their skills in various classes over the summer. Classes such as, Robotics, Minecraft Camp, Baking Classes, Self-Defense, Fun with STEM, Crafts, Fun with Duct Tape, Little Masters Gardeners, and many more. 
STEM course, Riverdale Elementary (rising 8th grade): I attended this summer camp everyday for a week to completely build a hydraulic robot. After it was built, I participated with many other students to complete various “games”, or tasks, with my robot. 
","Before I could even articulate the world around me into words, I was involved in a world of science. Dad’s office has been the place of some of my favorite childhood memories - a space where I wasn’t a child, but where I was important and influential.

Dad always let me interact with his projects, whether helping him complete AutoCAD drawings of power line systems in the city or trying to dissect complex diagrams of transformers being installed. My fascination with his career in electrical and mechanical engineering has turned into an appreciation of the things taken for granted, like how we can plug an appliance into a receptacle and never second guess that free-flowing electrons will be available in the exact frequency and voltage needed for the appliance to work. It has also led me to push myself to excel in terms of academic involvement so I can be an engineer like him. In addition to a love for electrical engineering, I also had an eye out for physics. It started when Dad handed me the largest Christmas gift under the tree, as I rapidly started to unwrap it I saw that it was a physics set. Ever since then, I have grown up beside this set.  I’d sit in the office across from my room for hours at a time just toying around with the thousands of small, complex pieces and endless amounts of activities. 

Unlike Dad, I’ve become more in touch with my creative, artistic side. I dared myself to enter pieces in local art contests and get involved with the Arts Department as a mentor to lower level art classes. I want to turn my passion into practice. I want to design, create, alter, improve, and construct. 

Like my art teacher always says, I want the world to be my canvas; my dad’s office - a free space to express myself and expand my mind. 
","The summer of seventh grade was my first real experience with a STEM program. Many of my Talented and Gifted classmates and I gathered over the summer to make a hydraulic robot. The class was invitational, and because of limited supplies only a few students were chosen. Luckily, my closest friends and I were the few to be chosen.
	Over the course of a week we had to follow complex instructions as well as learn all about general hydraulics and how it’s used. Every morning before we continued building our robots we had a small quiz on what we had learned the day before. At first, the instructions were relatively easy to follow and the robot wasn’t hard to put together. But, as the days continued, the instructions got shorter and we were forced to formulate our own ideas. The lack of in-depth instructions resulted in a bunch of failed robots. As the teacher instructed, we all took a few steps back and tried to find where most of us went wrong. Then, we were told to discuss, as a class, our ideas. The combination of ideas really helped to complete our robots. 
	Finally, we were able to utilize our robots to complete tasks and play games. While this class wasn’t completed upon grades, we were ranked based on our robots and its ability to complete these tasks. Once my classmates and I found out that we would be ranked, the tasks became suspenseful competitions. I would definitely do it all over again if I had the chance. This course really added to my love of engineering.","My path to engineering has not been solely summer classes and mentorship. In fact, a large part of it has nothing to do with my socialization in engineering. In the spring of ninth grade, I was faced with a hard decision. Softball sign-ups were coming out and Dad was expecting me to play, as he has pushed me to do since I was in elementary school. It became increasingly apparent how much time I was committing to something that had no tangible improvement on what was important to me - my education. I knew it would upset Dad, whose obsession with sports has lined my childhood memories, but also free my time. Time I could use to improve my skills in art, my academic involvement, and to try things sports has deprived me of, like scholastic bowl. Everyone has always doubted my drive to excel, which is why proving myself is my biggest long-term goal. Showing everyone who has ever doubted me, talked down on me, or plainly told me that I was unable to do something, that I can go above and beyond. This passion is not only channelled through outward anger, but introspective growth - proving myself to myself. Immediately, I felt like I had changed for the better, it felt almost as if a weight had been taken off my chest. 
C-Tech^2 gives me an opportunity to experience college life, something I’m extremely jealous of my brother for. Lately, all eyes have been on him because he is planning on going to a college in Pittsburgh to play baseball. I really want to prove that I can be successful, more than expectations, without playing sports. I want to prove to my family that it is possible and that no dreams are too big, and have fun doing it. Being selected for C-Tech^2 will give me a greater chance of fulfilling my dream of becoming an engineer. It will serve as the vehicle in which I can pave my future, the future I’ve dreamed about all my life. Yes, I am a girl and I want to be an engineer.

We made programmable headbands with Arduino boards from Adafruit that lit up LED lights stitched onto a headband with conductible thread. Another activity was to make turtle necklaces that were programmed to fade from one color to the next.   Lastly, we made small animations and games using the Alice program.","I would like to be an engineer because I have always been fascinated with finding out how things work. Getting formal training in engineering would allow me to use this knowledge to help solve societal problems, increase efficiency, and add comfort to our lives. I've grown up in a family of engineers and creative people, and I have learned to admire their ability to solve problems logically using their background in science and technology.   

Both my grandfather and great-grandfather worked as contractors for NASA and helped with the space program. The endeavors of my relatives and like-minded people, not only helped provide challenging jobs for many people, but also advanced the state of the art technology in rockets, life support, and computers. Recently, I saw the movie Hidden Figures about the women who did math problems for a living, the original 'computers'. This movie really inspired me to keep going and follow my dreams and to not be deterred because of a male-dominated field. I hope that someday my efforts as a female engineer will make a similar impact as that of my family members and great female engineers that have come before me.","In an electronics class, we were reviewing for a test. One of our review problems had a diagram of a circuit with parallel circuits and series circuits, and the goal was to solve for total resistance, total current, and assorted specific measurements. We had solved for all of the variables and plugged them back into the equations to see if our calculations were correct. They were not, and we discovered that someone had moved a decimal place over one too many times, and caused the rest of the equations to be wrong. We discovered this by re-checking all of our work, and double-checking all formulas. ","I should be selected for this program because I love engineering. I love how one can use math and logic to come to an answer and those answers can be used to make people's lives better. This camp would be a great way to help achieve my goals. Over the last couple of years, I have really tried to focus on school and I have come to appreciate the success that hard work can bring. There are not many opportunities for me to learn about engineering where I live and it would be helpful for me to go to a university setting to learn more about my passion. I love being challenged. If I am not being challenged, then I’m not learning. If accepted, this camp could help prepare me for college, challenge me in ways I have not previously been, and learn what to expect from a university. This camp is one way to make my engineering dream a reality and will help bring me closer to doing what I love. If selected, I would welcome the opportunity to learn from university staff and also get to know other girls with similar interests. Overall, this camp could really help me to achieve my goals and put me in a good position to learn and grow in the world of engineering.","By checking this box, I am electronically signing this online application and acknowledging that the information I have provided is accurate to the best of my knowledge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During the camp we built a robot through a kit, practiced programming the robot, and eventually programmed the robot to go through a maze and perform basic tasks like lifting and stacking objects.","My dad is an engineer, so I grew up around engineering, math, and science.  As I begin taking more advanced classes in high school, I find that I enjoy math and science the most because they involve actively trying to solve a problem or find a solution.  When I think about what career I want to have after I finish school, I think that I want to have a positive impact on the world, a job that will help other people, and make the world a better place.  An engineering job would allow me to make that positive impact by solving problems using math and science.","One time I worked as a team to solve a problem was when my Girl Scout troop helped organize a food drive for a local food pantry, Community for Helping Others (CHO).  As part of the food drive, our troop distributed food bins to places like the library so people could donate food.  We then collected all of the food that was donated (Scouts take turns collecting the food) and brought them to the pantry to sort.  This is my favorite part of the food drive, because we start out with bags and bags of food, and soon all of the food is organized by type and expiration date in the pantry.
	I also volunteer as a camp counselor at a Vacation Bible School in my neighborhood.  This requires a lot of teamwork because the entire church is transformed into Hogwarts (the camp is Harry Potter themed).  All of the walls get covered up by fabric ‘tapestries’ or paper painted to look like stone walls, and then all of the props go in.  Every year we have to organize which volunteers are going to decorate each room, and work together to create a fun, magical atmosphere for the kids.  On the first day of camp, we have to get all the children ‘sorted’ into their different houses, and take them around to different classes.  This is not only a great experience for me to work with others, but I also always have fun meeting new people and putting on the show for the kids!","I think that I would benefit from this program because I know that I am interested in engineering, but I’m not sure specifically what type.  This program would allow me to participate in projects involving different types of engineering so I can figure out what I am most interested in.  I am considering going to Virginia Tech for college and being able to work in the labs and visit the school would help me decide if the school is the right fit for me.  If I was accepted into this program, I think that others that I would work with could also benefit from my positive, optimistic attitude, as well as my creativity.  As the oldest of three sisters, I have plenty of experience getting an unlikely group to work together as a team.  I am also very organized; I often finish my school work ahead of time, and I have helped plan and carry out activities from weekend get-togethers with my friends to volunteer projects for Girl Scouts.","By checking this box, I am electronically signing this online application and acknowledging that the information I have provided is accurate to the best of my knowledge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I want to solve real problems and continue to learn throughout my adult career. I also want to work with many different types of people to come up with new ideas for the improvement of our future. Improvement is another reason engineering is appealing to me. I am always looking for ways to improve whether it is academically or physically just as engineers are always improving the things around them. Track has had a major impact on my desire to be an engineer because it has made me push myself physically and mentally. I want to pursue a career that will push me the same way. I believe that engineering will give me unique opportunities and continue to challenge me in a way that will better myself and the people around me. ,"As an officer in Math Honor Society, part of my job is to help the president make decisions on how the club is run. When the club first started, we began holding tutoring sessions two days a week. During this time, the National Honor Society also held tutoring sessions. As a result, many students went to National Honor Society's tutoring where there were few tutors and left Math Honor Society empty, where there were many tutors. As a group, the officers of both clubs collaborated and held tutoring sessions on the same two days and in the same room. Our solution helped many struggling students find a place where many math tutors were available to help them.","I should be selected for the C-Tech2 Program because I am extremely excited about the idea of exploring different branches of engineering. I have been interested in studying engineering for a while and I am currently trying to decide what type of engineering is for me.

ID Tech Programming: Two week course to learn programming and how to apply in in game design and making.","When I was young, I loved to draw. I used to be obsessed with doodling. The older I got, the better my drawing skills got so I decided to enroll in an art class at school. I continued to take art classes throughout my grade school education. Each year, these classes further developed my imagination and enabled me to think more creatively.

I continued taking art classes in high school, both privately with a local artist and as part of my high school curriculum. In my sophomore year, I discovered a class called Drafting and Design. This class introduced me to technical problem solving and allowed me to use my creativity as part of that process. After a full year of this class, I fell in love with applying my creativity to engineer solutions. This, coupled with my strong passion for math and science, led me to become interested in engineering. 

In the summer before my junior year, I enrolled in a program at Stevens Institute of Technology. The two week course offered daily in-depth engineering modules, This allowed me to explore the different disciplines of engineering and help me identify which area I was most interested in and suited for. 

I also had the chance in my junior year to participate in my father’s office’s “Bring Your Child to Work Day.” My father is a chemical engineer and works in a plant that manufactures medical devices for the World Health Organization. I toured the manufacturing areas and had the opportunity to see the production equipment and how some of the processes work. This real-life, up-close experience convinced me that engineering is what I want to do career-wise.
","During my summer experience at Stevens Institute of Technology, I worked as part of a team that grew bacteria to test whether it would glow in the dark. When the experiment was introduced to us we had to divide up roles. The only problems we encountered was when we answered questions and had different ways of answering them. After we discussed the answers a bit we were able to reach a compromise.
 

As I the project progressed, I learned many things about group work. First, communication is key. Engineering involves taking real world problems and calculating and finding solutions, through communication. If you do not effectively communicate, experiments could be incorrectly executed, generating erroneous data and confounded results.  

Second, three minds are better than one. I had two other group members and I quickly learned that we accomplished much more when we put our heads together. Cooperative work is common in the field of engineering and something which I really enjoy.

Last, I learned that in order to work as a cohesive unit, every group member must have and execute their responsibility. Without shared responsibilities one person ends up doing all the work, which promotes hard feelings among the team and hinders the ability to complete the work. 

","Ever since I was a child I have enjoyed making things, learning about the world, and interacting with people. As I have grown older I have realized I am constantly asking myself the same questions, how do things work, why they do what they do, and how can I do something better. While I am certain that I want to study engineering, there are so many different disciplines from which to choose. I believe VT's summer program will give me additional perspective and exposure to the various types of engineering, helping me to make the best choice for my education and my future. 

I should be selected for this program for a few reasons. First, I will bring creative ideas to this program that will enhance my experience and hopefully that of my fellow students. I have a more creative approach to solving problems, rather than a technological approach. Although I may solve problems differently, in my mind, this is an advantage because it allows me to look at a problem from another perspective. This can be very helpful, especially when finding a dead end in the process of solving a problem. 

Second, I feel my collaboration skills will enhance my experience. A large part of engineering is working as part of a team to solve problems and collaboration is one of the keys to success. I was recently chosen, as part of a highly selective process, to be part of a program which focuses on environmental sustainability in the developing Negev communities in Israel.  I am part of a group of teens that will partner with a similar group in Israel to review technologies for sustainable development. This program will help me build upon my teamwork skills which I will be able to apply to this program, my schooling and ultimately my career.

Both my parents are chemical engineers and I grew up doing science experiments at home. These experiments, from testing the vitamin C in drinks to wiring LEDs, sparked my interest in science at a young age. I had many fantastic opportunities to explore the world and how things work. I love both math & science and applying them to solve a problem.
I have had multiple opportunities to explore engineering and the problems involved. In Science Olympiad, I worked on designing a hovercraft that would move down the track at different speeds. I started just trying to get the hovercraft to move. I thought using computer fans would work, but in the first iteration they proved too heavy. For the second iteration, I tried helicopter motors, but it still did not work due to weight and the design of the base. I am still working on solving the problem of getting the hovercraft to move. The current third version is made with foam board and drone motors. It has been difficult, but I am gaining good experience and learning from each iteration.
Engineering is really exciting. Designs can always be improved. Whether one is stuck on the problem, or just found the solution. I love working through the problem and thinking about it even outside of meetings. The puzzle and challenge presented by each problem is unique and fun to conquer. I think the most engaging aspect of engineering is not necessarily the success, but the failures that motivate the engineer to make modifications and test to fix the issue. Engineering is about more than the final product. It is also about the path one takes to get there.
Some people say if one finds a job one loves, one will never work a day in his or her life. For me, that job is engineering. I have grown up in an engineering home and I love solving problem, that is why I will be an engineer.
","I have had many opportunities to collaborate with a team to work on an engineering challenge. The numerous robotics challenges and the Science Olympiad challenges are great examples of working on a team to achieve a goal.
One example of successful team collaboration was to complete an engineering challenge during FIRST Tech Challenge robotics (FTC) this year. The challenge this year was to design and build a robot to shoot balls into a center goal. The team was almost completely new this year. I had previous experience and became the leader of the team. I facilitated discussion and made sure all the ideas were heard. Throughout the year, I worked with others to teach them how to build the robot. I also did much of the programming. We worked together to build the robot and document our journey. We each worked on everything, learning and improving the robot. Each part of the robot went through many iterations. 
One system we made many iterations on was the shooter. There were three types of shooters we could do; a “choo-choo” shooter, flywheels, and a Lexan shooter. We each split up to prototype the shooter. One member prototyped a “choo-choo” shooter, but had trouble getting it small enough to put on to the robot. I worked primarily on the flywheels and mounting it on the robot. Another member started to prototype the Lexan shooter. I was able to get the flywheels working well, so we did not continue to test. We divided the work and got the job done.
However, working with the team was not always smooth because the team was relatively new and we were not used to working together. It took time to make sure all the ideas were heard and that all the members stayed on track so we could get the robot functioning. During the competition, the stress also added to the difficulties because everyone was on edge. Together, we overcome our differences and solved the engineering problem.
","I should be selected for the C-Tech2 program because it would be a fantastic opportunity to apply the engineering problem-solving process and gain exposure to new challenges and perspectives. I have a lot of experience with technical programs like FIRST Tech Challenge robotics (FTC), FIRST Lego League robotics (FLL), FIRST Robotics Competition robotics (FRC), Science Olympiad and One Health. I am highly motivated and I am constantly pushing myself in everything that I do. I know that I want to be an engineer, the only thing I am unsure about is which type. I believe that this program would be a great opportunity to learn more about the different types of engineering and help me decide what type I would like to be.  The program would also help me get to know Virginia Tech and its programs to help me decide where I want to go to college. I love learning and figuring things out in everything that I do and that is why I should be selected for this program.
I also know that being a female, I will be a minority in engineering. I see it now in my AP Physics 2 class where less than a fourth of the class is girls. I have also seen it when I try to recruit girls for my robotics team. I have found very few girls that are interested in robotics, even if they do well in math and science. This camp is a great opportunity to introduce engineering and help determine the difference between types of engineering. The metal casting and both software defined radio sound especially interesting and useful. The opportunity to talk to other women engineers will also be inspiring.
I am an excellent candidate for this program because of my drive and passion for engineering.

There are four main branches of engineering which can be broken down into may subcategories. Engineers play a big part in the development of the modern world from building skyscrapers to designing the self-driving cars or making modifications to cells resistant to cancer. These and many other engineering feats offer endless possibilities for adventure with an engineering background, particularly from Virginia Tech, where they are creating opportunities for students to learn innovative aspects of engineering. I would enjoy learning from the faculty where they are “Inventing the Future.”

Since a young girl I have taken an interest in the math and sciences. It was not until the 7th grade that I heard the acronym STEM. Learning what STEM stood for peaked my interest in math and science as a career path. I considered my academic strengths and weaknesses and thought being an engineer would be exciting because I would get to discover or design something new or make something that already exists better. Designing as an engineer could help make the world a better place whether that is a small or big impact. I want to be able to make a difference in my career and what better way to do that than through STEM. ","My 7th grade science teacher, Mrs. Marriott, really changed my life. It was the first time I recognized how much I had a passion for research and discovery. In Mrs. Marriott’s class we frequently worked in groups on lab activities and discussion. My favorite group activity was identifying different types of trees based on a few leaves she had collected. Another group assignment was a fungi lab. My partner and I won the competition for identifying all the fungi correctly. As we had more lab assignments I realized I really liked doing research where we tried to work backwards to figure out the answers.

Mrs. Marriot introduced me to a program through Iowa State called Science Bound. It is a program for minority students in 8th – 12th grade interested in STEM majors. We meet weekly working on science activities, guest speakers, and annual oral presentation on interest in STEM and future ideas in the field. We also attend on-campus visits to Iowa State once a month. I feel grateful to Mrs. Marriott that her classroom group activities peaked my interest in STEM and her nomination of me to the Science Bound program has meant that I continue to have the opportunity to explore the many facets of STEM.
","I was born in Christiansburg and raised in Blacksburg through 5th grade. My dad went to university at Virginia Tech and my parents met there while they were working in Athletics. I am considering Virginia Tech STEM programs in my top three choices for college. I am familiar with the campus and, in particular, the math and science programs. In elementary school I participated in Kids Tech University. I enjoyed it so much because we got to visit labs, interact with the college students, and try cool experiments. It made me start to see Virginia Tech had great science and math programs. Being accepted into C-tech2 not only would mean I would gain more understanding of what I began to learn as a child, it would also mean I could meet the current faculty and discover what Virginia Tech STEM has evolved to in the years I have been living in Iowa. I am aware that there are new buildings which I am excited to see and appreciate the building design for continuing innovation and discovery. Being a member of C-tech2 this summer would also offer an opportunity to meet other girls interested in what I am excited about learning. Every mentor I meet, program participant I interact with, and event I attend is one more step for me to being a successful African-American woman in STEM. I would also hope that I would lend to the C-tech2 program as a mentor and friend with the other girls in the program. I also think my knowledge and experience with STEM through Science Bound would be valuable to my peers. I appreciate the opportunity to learn from the program while also creating new relationships with girls that will last beyond the two weeks of the camp. Thank you for considering my application.

",,"I have always been passionate about learning math and science, and I have found that engineering is a field where one can associate knowledge and skills learned in the STEM fields with abilities to use imagination and creativity to either design or execute projects. Engineering can in fact be seen as the reason as to why our world functions the way it does today. With my love for math, I could just major in math and become a mathematician or possibly a math teacher, but those aren’t as appealing as engineering. I am specifically interested in chemical engineering, which deals with the application of math and chemistry in economical ways to further help humanity. Chemical engineering is used in multiple fields, such as pharmaceutics, consumer products, oil industry, microbiology, and much more. I want the work I do to help others and their lives, and engineering is a perfect mix of the two aspects I would like to pursue in my future- I can use math and numbers not just for my pleasure but now I can help the world. I have always had a love for numbers and working on solving problems that involve using them, so to be able to use this skill for the better of humanity would be a valuable ability for me to learn.","Last month in February 2017, I participated in Moody’ Mega Math Challenge along with three other juniors at my school. The M^3 challenge is an annual contest in which high students across the country applying math modeling to real-world problems. Students have 14 hours to write out a solution paper with their gatherings to answer the problem. This was the first time that I ever dealt with math modeling, and though in class I have answered word problems that deal with the real world, the questions have never been as detailed and complex as the one for this contest. My friends and I walked into working knowing that the problem would be different than any other problem we had ever answered, but we didn’t know it would be as challenging as it was. We also weren’t sure if we had the stamina to work for 14 hours straight. We ended up working for only 10 hours, and we answered almost all the parts of the question, but there were certain parts that we didn’t even know where to start. Even though we weren’t as successful as we had hoped to be, it was an experience that one cannot go through in class. We plan on doing it next year, learning from our first attempt and being able to improve from it.","I remember when I first realized that engineering would be the field to suit me best. I was in the 7th grade in my Algebra 1 HN class, which was what most took in the 8th grade. My teacher, Ms. Thompson, was my favorite teacher that year and I stayed after with her often. One class, she was talking of an event for students thinking of pursuing engineering, and she directly pointed me out and gave me a flyer, saying that engineering would be a good idea for me to consider. I ended up not going to the event because of schedule difficulty, but ever since then I have been intrigued by the field. I wouldn’t realize that I would want to particularly do chemical engineering until freshman year. I already have done research, visited colleges of engineering, but I haven’t been able to dive myself into the experiments of engineering firsthand. Two weeks at a college campus would be an ideal way to immerse myself in the activities of engineering.","By checking this box, I am electronically signing this online application and acknowledging that the information I have provided is accurate to the best of my knowledge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

","Nelson Mandela once said: “Education is the most powerful element that can be used to change the world.” Like Mandela, I believe that education is the cornerstone of success and high achievements. STEM-related opportunities impact and influence the future of our world by inspiring young individuals to expand their knowledge. As an individual with great interest in Math, Science, and Technology, I am passionate about becoming an engineer which will enhance our planet and further our understanding about science. I am passionate about being an engineer because I like to create advanced technology that can improve our society. Engineers help improve society and bring new technology into this world. Additionally, I love challenging problems and engineers are responsible for solving challenging problems. Engineers are required to attain several ways to solve problems using critical thinking and high-level skills.This is why I am passionate about becoming an engineer. ","I recently participated in a STEM-related program that influenced me to achieve my dreams. Technology Student Association (TSA), a club which offers many learning opportunities for high school students such as essay writing, creating websites, and researching was my highest achievement. I served as the secretary of this club and was responsible for recording minutes for each meeting. In 9th grade, my team and I worked on a project about electronic waste and its harmful impacts on our society.  We raised awareness about this serious issue and worked together to identify solutions. We created a website from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JAVA to inform individuals about how to properly recycle their electronics. Throughout this experience, I learned how to interact with others in my community and conduct further research on my topic. I also traveled to many e-waste recycling sites and interviewed staff to obtain greater insights into this topic. After many hours of research, coding, and interacting with others, we competed at a state level where we achieved 2nd place and qualified for Nationals. Throughout my work on this project, I developed effective teamwork skills by collaborating with my teammates to give recognition to the problem of e-waste. This competition relates to my interests in engineering because it required an extensive amount of computer engineering skills. Additionally, by visiting multiple sites, I learned about machines and how electronics function and how recent products are better engineered. Placing at nationals in Technology Student Association was one of my biggest achievements. This was an year long team-work project we did to raise awareness about electronic wastes. 
","I am a hardworking and dedicated student. In Math and science I not only complete the project but I contact further sources to gain and understand more about certain topics that interest me and am willing to put extra effort to understand complex concepts about topics that interest me. I also have a sturdy math background, which allows me to apply my skills in math to calculate for complicated scientific formulas. I currently took BC calculus as a sophomore and enjoyed the challenges it presented for me. I am eager to participate in this program to learn from my peers and professionals. Additionally, this program will enhance my skills as an engineer and expose me to different types of engineering and also interacting with several individuals to solve difficult problems. I enjoy challenging math problems and have great leadership and team-work skills. I have had experience in leading classes and being the leader of many different clubs. Additionally, I have had many projects such as science fair projects and engineering projects which requires teamwork. I enjoy working with other students who have similar interests as me and solving challenging problems. I believe I should be selected for this program to gain an insight of how to work with professionals and other students on campus at Virginia Tech.

This was an all girls engineering camp in which we learned about the nine principles of engineering and we completed three projects a day for an entire school week.","My journey in the realization of wanting to become an engineer began when I first attended “Introduce a Girl to Engineering” at Picatinny Arsenal (a government research and development center) in my freshman year of high school. I met many women engineers that were excited about their engineering career choice. I have come to desire to be an engineer because it allows me to turn my imagination into reality. Engineering is an outlet that allows me to express my ideas and creativity. It will give me the opportunity to work on a breadth of problems, including difficult issues that will make the world better, as well as solving simple problems which will allow people to have an easier, more enjoyable life. Engineering is involved in things we use on a daily basis, it has a great impact on the world. Being involved in that kind of career will not only give me new experiences, but will allow me to learn more every day. I have a strong desire to help and serve others, as evidenced by my yearly international mission trip to build communities and relationships with people living in impoverished areas. While other career choices provide an opportunity to help others, engineering has the opportunity to aid vast numbers of people. An additional reason why I want to become an engineer is that I can apply the skills that I learn to many different occupational areas ranging from the environment and healthcare to commercial or military products.","I had many amazing experiences working on teams and I have learned a lot about myself in the process. Last summer I attended a program named TARGET at Rutgers University. This was an all-girls engineering camp in which we learned about the nine principles of engineering and we completed three projects a day. One of the projects we had to make was a wind turbine. At the end of the project, whichever team’s wind turbine survived the blow dryer test the longest would win. I did not know anyone at this camp and we were randomly separated into teams each day. Many of the girls had been coming to the camp for years and this was my first year. I volunteered to be the group leader, listening to all our ideas, we decided on a design and proceeded.  We only had paper, a cup, straws, a spool, scissors and tape. With this, we cut a hole in the bottom of the cup and stuck a straw through it so that the rim of the cup was our base. Then, we bent the straw so it was at a ninety-degree angle. Then, we put on the spool with tape.  We cut straws in half and into a triangular shape. Then, we layered the triangles and taped them to the spool. Every other team decided to use origami windmills as their products, however, being the group leader, I wanted something more unique. Our counselor doubted our design and said our turbine would not spin well nor survive the blow dryer test. My team started to second guess our design and wanted to change it to be like the others.  I was able to convey the reasoning behind our design and explained that we should continue with it in confidence. The girls in my group started to get leery about our idea, but I continued to explain to them that we had the best idea out there. When it was our time to get tested with the blow dryer, our turbine not only spun well but was so strong that it held out longer than all the other turbines which collapsed. Therefore, I'm glad our team stuck to our design even when those around us doubted our ability.","I should be selected because I am passionate for engineering and my teamwork, knowledge and diligence will be an asset to others attending the program. I quickly acclimate to new environments and people and have good listening skills. I love a challenge and work well as a contributing member of a team in a positive way. I think out of the box and enjoy using my creative ideas and knowledge to resolve problems. In addition, when I realized that I wanted to be an engineer, I doubled up in my math classes and started challenging myself in honors and AP classes. I have prepared myself for this
opportunity through honors engineer design, AP physics, as well as advanced pre-calculus coursework at my high school, and my experience participating in the Rutgers TARGET program. When I first went on a tour of Virginia Tech, I fell in love with the campus, community of people and motto. When I noticed on the website that there was an engineering information session being held, I drove another eight hours back to VT to hear more. The engineering students showed passion not only for engineering but for engineering at VT. I learned about having the ability to dorm in a live and learn
environment, Hypatia. It sounded like a great support system for young engineering students. This was a big factor that played into my desire to pursue an engineering degree at Virginia Tech. Staying in the dorms this summer will help me get a realistic view of how life may be in the future. In addition, this curriculum will provide the opportunity to gain exposure to multiple engineering career fields and research which will overall help me decide which engineering field I’m best suited for. By attending C-Tech2 I plan on expanding my current knowledge base and engineering skill set while having the
ability to experience campus life with like-minded people, and gain the guidance of professors that are passionate about engineering.","By checking this box, I am electronically signing this online application and acknowledging that the information I have provided is accurate to the best of my knowledge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After 7 weeks of resea","The accomplishments of engineers as well as the application of science to solve real problems  have always fascinated me. In my direct family, there are six engineers. They constantly talk about different engineering achievements along with their own achievements. Being able to see them at work, talk to them, and witness their achievements has caused me to grow a passion toward the field. Since I was young, my family has inspired me to want to become an engineer since I saw how they took real problems and found a solution. Being able to do this gives me a sense of purpose since I am giving back to the society.  In addition to the inspiration from my family, I was and still am being inspired by other engineers. For example, Dr. Robert Langer, professor at MIT, created a material that can temporarily protect and tighten skin, and smooth wrinkles. It is often called, “A second skin.” This specific accomplishment is inspiring to me because it could be the basis for the artificial reproduction of tissue. For me, these kinds of inventions are incredible as they can change the lives of human beings and enhance the overall quality of life. This is another reason why I want to become an engineer.  I would like to help create inventions that will use my passion for both the engineering and medical fields to help others who have an illness. All the inventions relating to BME intrigue me and motivate me to learn more about engineering, attain highest honors at school, and to seek admission at Virginia Tech.","Recently, 5 students, including myself, decided to participate in the Lexus Eco Challenge. In this challenge, my friend and I were chosen to co-lead the team. Since we got to decide what problem to solve, we decided to try to sustain life in the school’s pond.  This task involved several challenges like not killing any existing life, having a tight budget, and getting multiple levels of approval from the administration. In addition to that, none of the members had taken an environmental science class. Because of that, this task was not easy, but it made the challenge more intriguing. We started our project earlier this year and are planning to submit it this fall.  The first step in our challenge was to conduct research since our knowledge was scarce on this topic. After the research was conducted, we decided to test the pH of the pond to determine if it was at a healthy level. Once the data was collected, we came up with several action plans. Since the weather was too cold to conduct the plan, we decided to finish carrying out our plan in April and the summer. However, in the meantime, we have created our plan and gotten it approved by the school. In addition, the environmental teacher approved our plan and is guiding us. Currently, since the weather is not practical to finish our action plan, we are researching to see if there is a more effective plan and we are meeting monthly to share our findings.","I believe that I will be a good candidate for Virginia Tech as I have received the Headmaster’s Honors last school year (meaning that I have received an average of a 97 or above all year), I currently have all A’s, and I am involved in several extracurricular and leadership activities. This summer, I should finalize the ranking and the application of my colleges and this camp will help place Virginia Tech as the top choice, will help me experience college life, and will help me gain access to information and technology necessary to best prepare me for my future. Engineering is a genuine interest of mine. I really would like to understand the different types of engineering. I also would like to experience, not just watch, what different engineers can create. I want to learn how they use their knowledge to solve real problems. I may have an idea of the type of engineer I would like to be, but I would like to keep my options open and make my summer useful to truly gain an understanding of what engineering is. Due to the small size of my school, not many engineering classes are offered. Because of that, I do not have many opportunities to learn about engineering at my school. Furthermore, not many girls at my school are interested in the field of engineering. This camp will help me build long-lasting friendships with girls who have a similar interest as me and will allow me to learn more about engineering. These are the main reasons why I believe you should select me for this program.","By checking this box, I am electronically signing this online application and acknowledging that the information I have provided is accurate to the best of my knowledge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is a one-day STEM program for rising 7th to 10th graders that introduces various fields of science such as geology, microbiology, network s","Throughout my entire life, I have always been interested in STEM fields. Chemistry, biology, physics, and calculus are some of my favorite subjects. I want to pursue an engineering career because engineering involves the subjects I enjoy, and I feel that I would be capable of performing tasks done by engineers. I could choose to pursue a science major or a mathematics major if I wanted to, but unlike engineering, science and mathematics are based on discovering the various laws of nature. By pursuing an engineering major, not only will I solely understand the universal laws, but I can also apply that knowledge into building a useful invention for human application. Creating an advantageous invention that has not existed in the past is what I aspire to do. I have always wondered how different mechanisms work and asked myself if I could build a similar object or improve how the mechanism works. From childhood to present day, I have added pieces of objects together and also took them apart, from Jenga and Legos to printers and Raspberry Pi. I prefer a workplace setting where teamwork and hands-on projects are involved. Though I love engineering itself, I am more intrigued towards biomedical engineering. Through biomedical engineering, I could brighten hope for those who are in need of artificial limbs. I understand that many individuals aren’t willing to donate their organs, and that is their personal choice, but it is not fair for those who are suffering without certain limbs or organs. By inventing artificial organs, limbs, and cells, I could improve the life of handicapped people and animals. It is stunning to think of a hearing aid, a small device that not only greatly impacts the patient’s sense of hearing but also could not have been made without biomedical engineering. Engineering is not only a profession, but is also a humanitarian service. I aspire to be a biomedical engineer because it unlocks my passion to express my creativity while helping the world.","During my freshman and sophomore years of high school, I was a student at the Center for Engineering at Burton Center for Arts and Technology. One of the projects I worked on with my class was figuring out how to generate electricity while protecting the environment with nearby resources in the engineering department. Together, my class did research on the various methods of producing electricity. We came to an agreement to test the effect of microbial fuel cells (MFC’s) on the consumption of iron to generate electricity since MFC’s can produce chemical energy which can convert to electrical energy when attached to a battery. In order to prove that, we built a battery made of two plastic boxes, some gauge copper wires, and carbon cloth. Some students constructed the cathode and anode chambers of the battery from the two plastic boxes. Meanwhile, some other students and I designed the electrodes by cutting the ends of gauge copper wires and weaving the exposed wires into the carbon cloth to ensure that they were close in contact in order to produce enough electricity. Then we constructed the Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) by creating a salt “bridge” since inorganic and metallic salts are beneficial for the exoelectrogen growth environment. Then we visited the local creek to collect samples of benthic mud to obtain mediator-less, anaerobic microbes which were exoelectrogenic. The class assembled the materials together to make the battery. After ninety-six hours, we measured and recorded the electric potential difference by utilizing a voltmeter. To display the electricity being generated, we installed a light bulb into the circuit which visually displays the power used by the generated electricity. Through collaboration among classmates, we conserved time and were able to complete tasks efficiently with the help of each other’s knowledge and assistance. We gave each other suggestions on what to build and how each piece functions to help solve the situation.","I would be an exceptional candidate for this program because I have the potential to study engineering in college, and I believe this program will provide me with a new perspective of the engineering field. Throughout my academic life, I could easily grasp STEM-related subjects in school compared to language arts and social studies. Biology, physics, calculus, and engineering are some of my favorite subjects, which led me to find interest in Biomedical Engineering. When I attended the Center for Engineering at Burton Center for Arts and Technology, I had experience with AutoDesk CAD and Inventor softwares, CNC and lathe machines, Alice program, and West Point Bridge design software. I wish to broaden my engineering abilities and gain access to more equipment in this program while acquiring more information about the different engineering fields offered at Virginia Tech. I am very hardworking towards my academic and life goals, and I enjoy challenging myself to learn new ideas. I perform my best to accomplish tasks on time. I am eager to socialize with other students in this program who share similar interests with me. I cooperate well with others and am open-minded to other’s opinions. I am down to earth and amenable to reason. I should be selected for this program because I believe that my social and academic skills would be suitable for this program.","By checking this box, I am electronically signing this online application and acknowledging that the information I have provided is accurate to the best of my knowledge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For example, for that past three years I have worked on a science fair project to develop a new modification for fishing piers that would help reduce beach erosion. One of the biggest influences in the field of Engineering has been my dad, who is a Mechanical Engineer (VT Alumni). I like talking to my dad about what does at work and I like helping him brainstorm ideas for new products. I enjoy helping him fix things around the house and trying to fix things in a new and exciting way. I would like to combine my Visual Arts background with my technical skills to create appealing and functional products in the future. ","I was a member of and Engineering Club at my school which consisted of  6 males and me.One time in the Engineering Club at my school, we tried to hand make a ping-pong table out of PVC pipe and plywood. We had a hard time trying to figure out how mu PVC pipe we would need to make it. Once we cut the pipe and connected it with connectors we measured the surface area needed for the top of the table using the length and width of the PVC pipes and then added four inches to the measurements so that the edge of the table would extend off the base a little bit. Then we cut the table top out of plywood and placed it on top of the base. We tried many way to secure it before finally deciding on zip ties. We then put eyelets on the bottom of the plywood to put the zip ties through. With this project I found that sometimes the most simplest ideas can solve the most complicated problems. I also learned that to make a project work, a team needs: cooperation, flexibility and respect. ","I should be selected for this summer program because I would like to learn more about the field of engineering and all it has to offer me in the future. Currently, I am limited by my school program and feel the need to find outside sources for learning. I feel I work well with many different groups of people and I enjoy learning new things from them. I am good at teaching others and helping them understand a concept that they have a hard time grasping, I am a natural leader. Above all, I will be applying to the Virginia Tech  Engineering program  in 2018 and this program will give me the opportunity to  experience the engineering department and college community that I hopefully will attend.

","        My interest in becoming an engineer began at an early age with the creation of LEGO structures and robotic arms. One of the best days of my life was when I received a large black garbage bag filled with a plethora of various LEGO pieces. I enjoyed the opportunities it provided for open-ended designs and exploring new areas of engineering.  
	Throughout my early teen years I had the opportunity to explore with more advanced types of engineering tools. Girl Scouts offered me the opportunity to attend a women in engineering conference that introduced me to many different S.T.E.A.M. fields and how women are currently involved. The keynote speaker was a local woman who was selected to be on the first space exploration to Mars. I was further enthralled with engineering by attending B.L.A.S.T.; an engineering camp held at Virginia Tech. B.L.A.S.T. opened my eyes to the endless possibilities that engineering has to offer. The moment I knew I was hooked on engineering was when they asked us to build a 12-foot structure out of only spaghetti and marshmallows. Being able to create a solution the seemingly impossible drew me in and I haven’t looked back since. Since then I have sought out more opportunities to build and design more advanced solutions.  
	Currently I am working on my Girl Scout Gold Award, the highest award Girl Scouts of America has to offer. For my project I am introducing S.T.E.A.M. activities to at-risk youth in my community.  As a part of my project I am volunteering as a program aid for my school district’s women in engineering initiative, Girls Gone Geek. 
	Ultimately, my desire to become an engineer stems from an interest of solving problems and meeting the needs of my community. The engineering fields that interest me the most are nuclear, structural, and mechanical. I am hoping that this camp can help me further narrow my field of interest and help me focus my academic path while in college. 
","One opportunity that I had to work with a team of students to develop a prototype was with my Engineering Explorations class. In this class we had to collaborate, think critically, effectively communicate and then use our plans to construct a survival tent. The tent itself had a very strict set of constraints; had to be able to be assembled in five minutes or less, could not be modeled after any tent already on the market, had to withstand winds of 30 mph or higher and it had to withstand a fire burning at 900 degrees or more. The tent also had to be waterproof or water resistant, and keep the occupant off of the ground. Many of my teammates had different ideas on how to tackle this challenging task. We had to communicate effectively and work together to construct our tent. Our team of seven students, of which I was the only female in the class, worked very well together and our prototype was the only one selected for the school’s first semester expo. ","I feel that I should be selected for this opportunity because of my long-standing interest in the S.T.E.A.M. fields and specifically my deep passion for engineering. I am a hard worker and an enthusiastic team player. I am an effective communicator, skilled collaborator, as well as a creative and critical thinker. My academic record demonstrates my commitment to education. I have received several awards for my athletic skills as well as my academic efforts.  My community involvement and extracurricular activities all support my commitment to my community and to the field of engineering. I very much want to explore all of the choices that engineering has to offer so that I can focus my energies when I continue my education at the university level.

As an avid reader who can read a five hundred page book in one day if the material captivates me as the sciences do, I am undaunted by the prospect of reading textbooks and published papers to as part of a career in engineering. Yet, my interest in engineering extends beyond an academic one; it is a chance to challenge my mind and come up with new ideas. For me, engineering would be a giant puzzle with endless motivations to solve it, and puzzles always engross me until I find the answer.  Every logic answer I’ve meticulously worked out and five-star Sudoku I’ve completed has prepared me for a career chasing answers and creating my own, when necessary. Finding answers to complex enigmas has always been my passion, whether it be pestering my teachers with my endless questioning, “But why?” or persistently Googling how the cold medicine I take makes me feel better, or scrutinizing everyday inventions to puzzle out in my head how they work. I want to work with my fellow engineers to solve problems no one else can, resolve enigmas my successors will be glad to be free of, and pass on findings that they will add to. I want to understand everything involved in my field; I want to study every aspect of engineering and then augment the field with my findings.  I can’t imagine any career more fulfilling than being an engineer, because no other profession is as innovative and constantly changing, and no other field can feed my fervent curiosity and rapid-paced creativity as engineering can.","It was one of the first Physics labs of the year, designed to teach us the applications of kinematics, free-fall, and two-dimensional motion. My lab group was set the task of calculating how high a ramp should be raised in order to allow a marble to roll down the ramp, onto the table, and drop to the floor. A target was placed on the ground, and the closer to the center of the target the marble fell, the higher our grade would be. The stakes had never been higher. My group was quickly overrun with loudmouths spouting erroneous ideas for our procedure, and I found that my objections to the plan were being ignored, so I sat down apart from the group with a few other members who were more open to rethinking our intended procedure. I restated the faults I had found within our original plan and suggested a different approach. By listening to each other’s ideas and carefully considering each step, my group and I came up with a more accurate plan for the lab. We presented our idea to the rest of the group, who came around to our way of thinking when presented with our better thought out methodology. After that lab, not only did I better understand concepts I had previously studied, I learned the importance of working as a team. The loud group members at the beginning were unable to see the errors in their plan because they were unwilling to listen to different ideas. The procedure I came up with on my own was not as efficient as my group’s final product, which took into account the viewpoints of more people (and earned us a 100%). The same concepts I mastered in that lab were helpful to me again in a later lab, when I used velocity triangles to determine what factors affect the period of a pendulum in simple harmonic motion.  I would never have understood these theories well enough to apply them, or had the confidence to share my ideas with my classmates and contribute to our discussion, had it not been for that first, invaluable lab experience.","The C-Tech^2 program is designed to show girls who are interested in engineering what a career in engineering is really like. This would help me enormously, as I know all of the theoretical aspects of the career I’m considering. I’ve studied physics, chemistry, and pre-calculus and enjoyed all these courses while also working extremely hard at each of them.  I’ve considered the difficulty of the job I’m hoping for, and the daily challenges I would face in such a rigorous career, and I know that not only am I up to the challenge, but nothing would make me as happy as working as hard as engineering requires.  No other career would puzzle me and focus my mind so completely on solving the problem in front of me.  The science classes I take intrigue me, and simultaneously always lead me to wanting to help create the innovations I read about, or discover the new theories I am fascinated by. There is little opportunity in my school or wider community to actually put these ideas into practice and learn more about what it really is to be an engineer, beyond the conceptual aspects that are so compelling to me.  So few of my peers understand the passion and confidence I already have for my intended career, and I wish to meet individuals who are as excited about math and science and determined to learn more about engineering as I am.  I am eager to learn more about the career I am working so hard for, and I will participate in the program with great enthusiasm.  If given the chance to attend, I will be open-minded, attentive, and passionate about the subject matter and projects in discussion. This is the career I want to excel at, and I would work extremely hard at any chance to start learning more about my dream.  I would be grateful for any chance to discover more about the career I want to dedicate my life to, and the ways in which I may one day contribute to my field.","By checking this box, I am electronically signing this online application and acknowledging that the information I have provided is accurate to the best of my knowledge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

","The Richmond Minorities in Engineering Partnership (RMEP) is a local non-profit organization, which was officially incorporated in July 1978 as Richmond Area Programs for Minorities in Engineering (RAPME) with 10 industry sponsors with a goal to achieve greater diversity in science and engineering. Today, RMEP is managed by a board of STEM professionals from the academic, corporate, and government sectors.RMEP was formed to establish a mechanism by which minority middle and high school students can be encouraged to consider science and engineering as a profession, thereby assisting in the national effort to alleviate under representation of minorities in all engineering professions. RMEP is an exemplary program of collaborative efforts that bring together two partner institutions: Virginia State University and Virginia Commonwealth University; to offer our signature Summer Engineering Institute.With the passion, experience, and knowledge, RMEP continues to set strategic directions to maintain a pipeline of minority students across the science and engineering disciplines.

P.O. Box 26248 Richmond, VA 23260,804-420-2674,RvaMEP@gmail.com","An engineer must have many strengths to be successful in this field but they must also possess certain characteristics. Engineers have the responsibility of finding solutions to problems.  They must persistently seek and pursue solutions. They ask the questions, why or why not? Engineers cannot be discouraged by not obtaining success in short frames of time. These things are achieved by their curiosity, determination, and creativity. I have an infinite desire to learn. By gaining knowledge, I not only improve myself as a person but also my opportunities and experiences in life.
 
I am an engineer of the world’s future. My personal strengths, curiosity to seek the answers to the unknown, a determination to achieve my goals and to discover imaginative ways to embrace life, designate success as my primary goal. I believe that these qualities and characteristics exist in every good researcher and innovator. An engineer must be able to consider things that are impossible to the average mind. It is essential to uncover how something can be done differently or better. Engineering is the centered of innovation. Every new invention came from reflecting on what was needed and the way that the need could be met. 

My love of the math and science is evident by my participation in STEM based programs for the past 6 years. The classes I took at Math and Science Innovation Center taught me about natural sciences, different ecosystems, and to be concerns for the future of the planet. Richmond Minorities in Engineering, exposed me team building and problem solving exercises, as well how to research and develop answers to current problems. The C-Tech2 summer engineering program introduced me to different types of engineering.  These programs have ignited my love of the STEM fields. I want to be an innovator and originator; discovering, experiencing and accomplishing what has yet to be done. I want to be an Engineer!
","The International Baccalaureate program required community service, group projects and an extended essay. 

My weekly community service requires my leadership skills and working as part of a team, volunteering at a hospital and interact with patient and staff from diverse backgrounds. I am assigned to the neuro telemetry unit.  The nursing staff need me for non-medical issues; escorting patient and family answering phone, and getting non-medical supplies for patients.  I make sure that any medical issues are communicated to the staff immediately. I am a trainer for new volunteers and I always ensure the team approached is used. We work as a team to provide the best care for the patients.

One of my group project consisted of visual video to evaluate applied knowledge areas. Being able to work with my peers was necessary. We first determine who would be responsible for each section. The project consisted of written script, verbal video script, and editing. We had to organize each component, plan our schedules and meet the required assignment due date. There was a time constraint because we only had one day where everyone was available to meeting and complete the first draft of the project.

My extended essay, evaluated the health aspect of authentic African food. It was necessary to work with others in order to complete everything in a timely and efficiently manner. My team members changed according to the phase of the project.  My mother was an essential parts because she was my mode of transportation and financial support. Communicating clearly with her, was necessary to make this project go smoothly. It was also essential to coordinate with my project supervisor to review my progress. Because of my brother’s expertise on African cuisine he was recruited to ensure the dishes remain authentic to traditional African dish. 

Each of these team efforts required critical thinking and clear communication thought out the process in order to have the best outcome.
","I should be considered for this program because my future goal is to have a career in the one of the STEM fields. My personal strengths are to always aim for excellence and a love of learning. I also possess qualities that are needed to be a good scientific researcher. A good engineer must be curious, have determination and be a creative thinker. These strengths and qualities have allowed me to accomplish my academic and personal successes thus far.

I believe the pursuit of excellence is the initiative to be the best that one can be. My scholastic achievements are evidence that I strive to be the best.  I take great effort to maintain high academic standards.  This authenticates my dedication to being on top, while continuing to work to be better.  It displays my commitment to the task and necessary follow-through. To reach my goals, I will never deny myself out of an opportunity to improve my position for the future.  Therefore, I must formulate a plan, accommodate circumstances, restructure if needed, and be prepared to seize the opportunity at all times. My obligation to excellence has enabled me to not only achieve academically but to also be successful in other aspects of life. I participate in several church ministries and school athletics program. These are areas in my life where I consistently perform and push to improve my skills and execution. My love of the math and sciences is evident by my participation in STEM based programs for the past 6 years.  My experience at C-Tech2 last summer was one of my best programs. I though engineering was limited to particular areas but this program introduced me to a very board spectrum of this field. The options are endless.  I met liked minded students form from diverse backgrounds and cultures and gain lifelong friends.
If given the opportunity to attend this program again it will help reinforce that the STEM educational path is what I truly want.

I am the type of person who is extremely proactive and always try to solve problems that I see in the real world. I then am able to use skills in engineering to solve those problems. I want to become an engineer because I believe that engineering is the key to solving the world’s most difficult problems. For example, I used CAD to design a trophy that my school handed out for the “Student of the Year” award. I also engineered a special rack to hold the mats that go on top of the gym floors during school dances. This rank makes it simple to lay out the heavy mats in an efficient manner, and pick the mats back up.

I want to be a part of a legacy that my family has created long before I was born. My dad is a professor at Virginia Tech, and he works in engineering every day. He always reminds me that engineering is the basis of our entire world and that every single thing that we do is all thanks to one's creativity and simple ideas. I want to be able to continue to face challenges and break boundaries by breaking the stigma of no women and engineering and show the world that I can solve any problem that comes my way. 
","One of the most difficult situations I have ever found myself in is a team project that I led in the Technology Student Association. This was a team competitive event called ""Biotechnology Design,"" where I and my team had to create a solution that involved some sort of biotechnology that solved a problem in outer space. We decided to research oxygen depletion, and how photosynthetic microbes were able to facilitate oxygen replenishment aboard the International Space Station. This was especially interesting because our group had a very weird dynamic. The group was comprised of ""alpha"" type personalities that often clashed ideas. I had to learn to be patient with my peers so everyone's ideas could be heard. I also learned that regardless of what others may think, everyone had a leader inside of them. I had to step down from the leadership position to let others learn to lead so that everyone had a fair chance to share their ideas. After months of nonstop brainstorming and working, we eventually completed the project and went to the state competition. Our presentation was by far my favorite part because we were able to showcase the parts of the project that we were most proud of, and how we each contributed a fair amount of work to complete it. We ended up winning 1st place! ","
“The key to increasing knowledge is to surround yourself with high achieving people. Don’t be the smartest person in the room. That way, you’re able to learn from those around you and improve your understanding,” said my father once. He described how this mantra motivated him to graduate from India’s highest ranking university. At 10 years old, I was astounded by his accomplishments. My father was and still is my biggest role model, and I want to make him proud. 

Today, at 17 years old, I finally understand what my father meant. He and I want to be surrounded by highly intelligent and motivated individuals who are dedicated to their passion. Through C-Tech^2, I will be able to meet these individuals and further enhance my knowledge in several different fields of science and engineering.

For generations, my family was involved in aerospace and engineering. My grandfather, a pilot, and mechanical engineer started this legacy in the Indian army. My father, a professor at Virginia Tech, completed several significant projects with Boeing, the United States Military, NASA, and SpaceX. I intend to continue my family’s legacy and go into aerospace engineering, focusing on improving flight endurance technology. I believe each person has a story to share. By attending this program, I’ll meet other students and hear their own passions and stories. 

While I strive to achieve and succeed, I don’t want to be the smartest person in the room. I want to be in an environment in which I’m challenged. That’s the type of environment where I’ll be able to develop and perform at my peak. While learning from others and gaining knowledge and experience I couldn’t attain elsewhere, these students will motivate me to work harder and build upon my family’s legacy to better the world.

Engineers can do so many things, from creating huge buildings to developing new software and so much more. Whether they are working with space shuttles or skyscrapers, engineering is a field where people are encouraged to be innovative and build wondrous things.  In the growth of this nation and the world, engineers continue to accomplished feats that nobody would have thought possible. I have been fortunate that my family has had some influence on me as well. I have two older brothers who are both about to graduate from college; one studying mechanical engineering at Virginia Tech and the other studying software engineering at James Madison University. My brothers and I have always shared similar interests, with engineering being one of the many. They have shown me how problems can be solved through engineering, and how different fields of engineering will shape the future. I, personally, have been the most interested in the computer science area of engineering, because I believe it holds the most potential for creativity and growth. Computers are in the big picture still relatively new to us, and we have only seen the beginnings of what can be achieved with the help of computers. When engineering goes hand in hand with computer science, incredible things can be created, like artificial intelligence, robots that can complete surgeries, and driverless cars.","There are numerous times that I have worked on team projects, but there is one that stands out in my mind. This memorable event happened last summer at a camp I was attending in the Pocono Mountains.  The campers were put into teams of 12 for a big scavenger hunt that required may different tasks. Some of these activities required you to answer questions on music and trivia, some involved finding certain objects around the campsite. There were also worksheets on historical trivia and science trivia that needed to be answered.  As you can see, it would take a lot of people to complete all these tasks.  The people in my group had to split up and work on the tasks that they were best at. For example, the best runners in the group chose to find things around the campsite, since they could go to different places to look for the objects the fastest. The people who knew the most about music worked on the music trivia, the people who knew the most about history worked on the history trivia, and the people who knew the most about science worked on the science trivia. I chose to work on the science trivia because I knew that that was my best area and that I would be the most help there. Our team effectively completed all the activities and we finished everything with time to spare.  The judges were impressed with how efficiently we completed every task and with our accuracy in doing so.  We actually won first place! This experience showed me how helpful effective teamwork can be and how it can be used for all kinds of situations.","I would love the opportunity to attend the C-Tech2 program at Virginia Tech this summer to help expand my knowledge of engineering. The field of engineering has always intrigued me. I want to go to college to study engineering and plan to pursue a career in the field. I think it would be a ton of fun to be in a setting with other girls like me who also enjoy engineering. I am willing to work hard and complete projects, which I can hopefully implement at this camp. I love challenges and working with a team to solve them. I attend a Math and Science specialty center at my high school, which requires that students take more advanced classes in all areas. These classes certainly provide more challenges than regular high school classes. Also, these classes incorporate lots of group work, so I have experience in being part of a team and completing challenging tasks with others. Virginia Tech has also been one of the top colleges that I have been interested in – and after my first football game there, I was even more convinced. I would like to have the opportunity to explore the campus and see everything the university has to offer. Overall, I believe that this camp would be an excellent experience and I would absolutely love to attend.","By checking this box, I am electronically signing this online application and acknowledging that the information I have provided is accurate to the best of my knowledge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

-Summer research intern (NSWC Carderock)
During the past two summers I have conducted research alongside my mentor in field of electrochemistry. A few examples of projects I have completed during thi","Epidemics. Poverty. Pollution. Cancer. These are all problems that wreck havoc on our planet, and these are all problems that engineers work to solve. When I enter the work force, I want my work to help others, and what better way to do so than by being an engineer?

Additionally, I genuinely love math, science, and being challenged, and I believe that engineering is the perfect embodiment of these focuses. During the past two summers as a research intern at the Naval Surface Warfare Center (Carderock), I was able to discover my love for research, which is also a key factor in the field of engineering. 

Spending my career as an engineer surrounded by research and STEM topics while working to help others is a clear win-win situation for me, and that’s why I know I want to be an engineer. 
","During my summer research internship, there was a period of time when one of the machinery vital to my testing was not transferring data correctly. Additionally, my mentor Dr. Smith was on travel for work for a few weeks, so I was left under the supervision of her very capable, but less experienced assistant, Mr. Baker, and between Dr. Smith over the phone, Mr. Baker, my fellow intern Khiem and I, we couldn’t figure out how why this unit of equipment, called the BK Precision, wasn’t working correctly. 

After a few days, I remembered that Dr. Smith had written down a phone number of a technology support personnel who had helped her in the past with the BK Precision. While speaking on the phone with her, she proposed that we call him.

Mr. Baker has very poor hearing, and knew that talking on the phone would be an unsuccessful hassle, and my fellow intern Khiem wasn’t as comfortable or confident with making the phone call, so I stepped up to the plate and volunteered to make the call.

I remember the technology support’s name was Mike, and I remember punching in the phone number with nervous energy, hoping that he could help fix our problem as my tests depended on it. With Mike’s help, I was able to adjust the equipment’s programming and settings and got the BK Precision unit working just the way we wanted. 

It was a truly rewarding experience to see my time and effort positively affect the workplace, and I made a guide for the BK Precision, complete with step by step instructions and pictures, on how to properly use the BK Precision unit to run cell discharges, transfer data, and then graph the data most efficiently. Before my internship ended, I gave a demonstration to Dr. Smith, Mr. Baker, and Khiem on how to use the BK Precision so that when I was gone, the procedure would be straightforward, smooth, and absent of the obstacles I had to face and conquer.
","I know I share many of the same qualities and possess similar experiences as other C-Tech2 applicants. 

I’m positive there are other applicants who love STEM topics as much as I do. 
I’m sure there are other applicants who also perform well academically while juggling multiple extracurriculars. 
I would be surprised if other applicants hadn’t also tried their hand in research, whether it was through the school science fair or a research opportunity. 
I know that other applicants have teacher recommendations crooning their hardworking, cooperative, and motivated students. 

However, what I believe sets me apart from others is what I would contribute during the C-Tech2 program. 

I am confident that I will be able to contribute to the learning environment at C-Tech2 with my naturally friendly and positive personality. With every smile, every little joke, every simple ‘hello’ and introduction, I can play a part towards creating an open environment for me and my fellow campers to connect and feel comfortable, which I believe will translate directly to our hands-on engineering experiences. I hope to knock down the barrier of being afraid to ask for help or clarification, which will help me and the other girls make the most of the unique opportunity given by C-Tech2. 

In my group of friends at school, I have found myself being the first person people turn to for help and advice, and I would gladly take on that responsibility at C-Tech2. Communication and teamwork are principle components of being and engineer, and I believe that I will prompt these skills with my fellow campers at C-Tech2, which is why I believe I should be selected for this program.

","This is going to be my 2nd summer in USA.

During 1st summer (I had just arrived in USA in May 2016), I had volunteered as Counsellor-in-Training for Rec-Pac, Fairfax, Virginia, where I helped in conducting a camp for elementary school kids. 
I also successfully completed an online summer course on 'Economics and Personal Finance'. (2016)","I want to be an Engineer, because it gives me joy when I can break things down into their technological elements, and understand how they work. And if I can make some small improvement in them, to make them work a little better, the joy is even greater. 
In my opinion, Engineering is more of a thought process. Engineers are trained to think a certain way. Engineers are problem solvers who use every resource available to make something unsatisfactory, satisfactory. They break down the problem into its components, and then understand each component. This systematic approach helps them in finding solutions to complex problems. I too want to get trained in this art which applies concepts of science and technology to solve real life problems, and make a difference to the society.
I find Engineering attractive, because it is not just about logic, but also about creativity. In an age where technology changes each minute, Engineers are involved in thinking new ideas, creating new things, and coming up with solutions to new problems. I also want to become a part of this community.  
I am a ‘numbers’ person. I enjoy Maths, Science, and Computers. ‘How It’s Made’ is my favorite TV show. I get excited when I get school assignments to create Java programs to simulate real life situations – like computer simulation of the game ‘Bingo’, or developing a dummy ‘Siri’ - new language processor. I find that I am good at writing programs that are simpler, yet do the job effectively.
I understand that Engineering is not an easy subject. My father, a Textile Engineer, tells me that you can never learn Engineering completely, rather, its always ‘work in progress’. This continuous challenge, learning and experience that this field offers, makes me say “I want to be an Engineer”.","I would like to describe the instance when last October, I was part of a 6 member team that was asked to do a group-dance for our Community’s annual cultural festival. 
Since it was an Indian Community event, we had decided on doing a ‘Bollywood’ dance on a popular ‘Hindi’ number. The problem was that the other 5 girls did not know ‘Hindi’ well, so they did not understand the meaning of the song’s lyrics. However, the music was so upbeat and popular, that we wanted to dance on that number. Being fluent in Hindi, I was given the task to understand the lyrics, and assign steps to all six of us, based on the lyrics. 
Though it sounds simple, the task was full of pitfalls. Each girl, including myself, wanted to be in the limelight when the most popular part of the lyrics was being played. It was clear that my friendship with the girls depended upon how I went about assigning the lyrics. Any perception of bias towards one girl, and I was at the risk of losing at least four wonderful friends. 
I went about doing the task, my preferred way, which is by breaking the problem into its components, understanding each component, and then finding an optimum solution, that benefits the team. I analyzed that since the lyrics had reference to height, hair, weight, and complexion of people, each of us fitted very well, in some part of the lyric, and made the song more meaningful. I discussed this logic with the group, and everyone saw the benefit in assigning the steps based on the lyric’s meaning. 
It turned out that the dance was a major hit, as the dancers fitted-in very well with the lyrics. More importantly, I made some very good friends for life.  
","While there could be several deserving candidates, I stand out on following points: 
First, I am a serious candidate, who fully realizes the importance of this opportunity. I have an interest in pursuing Engineering. This program will give me the insights, which will help me in making the right choices at the time of college admissions. An opportunity to spend a couple of weeks in the world-famous Virginia Tech campus, interacting with professors, students, and fellow-campers, is invaluable. While I will definitely have fun, I will remain focused on the objectives of the program.
Second, I will bring cultural diversity to this group. I did my schooling upto grade 9 in India. I moved to USA in May 2016 as a sophomore. I am excited to interact with students from different cultures during this summer program. Coming from a developing country, I can add perspective to the discussions, about the challenges faced by a third-world country, and how Engineers can provide solutions to those challenges.    
Third, I have the right aptitude for undertaking this program. I have always obtained good grades in Maths & Science subjects. I was nominated for the National Honors Society. I have good communication and reasoning skills, and so in the first year itself, I have represented my school in two Model United Nations sessions. I am a member of my school’s Tennis team. Besides, I am also a member of the India club and the Keys club in my school, where I am involved in organizing events, and mentoring younger kids. 
Last, but not the least, I am an enthusiastic girl, who brings energy to any group. I am a team player who values the diverse perspectives offered by the team mates, and can contribute effectively to any team activity.

Robotics",,"I want to be an engineer because the ever-changing field fascinates me.  As technology is advancing humans are living lengthier more superior lives and I want to be a part of that movement.  Specifically, I aspire to be a biomedical engineer.  Medicine to me is helping people and improving livelihoods, it is a rewarding field with endless possibility.  This is why I chose biomedical engineering as my goal career.  My dream job is to build prosthetics for military amputees.  I want to help those told the odds are against them and give them their lives back.  I am passionate about military amputees because they live athletic lifestyles, and being an athlete myself I understand the joy of running and lifting and the heartbreak of defeat.  As I could imagine losing a limb could feel like defeat.  Through giving them the ability to hold their kids again or carry the groceries for their wives, families become stronger.  I likewise desire to build robotic prosthetics to give full mobility back whether it is an arm or a leg; I wish it to feel to the client as if they were born with it.  Aside from wanting to help people, I genuinely enjoy designing and creating and the feeling I get when a robot I've built turns on and drives for the first time.  In conclusion, my passion is creating because it is through the process of creation that there is advancement.","I enjoy the team aspect of engineering.  My first team was soccer when I was three years old.  I also compete in the Met PGA.  My freshman year of high school I competed on three varsity teams. I always thought it was the competition that I loved.  I was wrong.  This year I founded my school's robotics team and served as captain.  I designed the robot and then together with fourteen girls built, wired and programmed it from the ground up.  It has been through this experience that I have realized what I really loved about sports.  It is working as a team together with a common goal.  My robotics team has attracted a lot of attention as we are the only all girl team on the east coast.  We also have been very successful.  We will be competing at Hofstra at the end of March in FIRST Robotics.  We are striving for the rookie award and have worked tirelessly towards it.  Our robot can transport and deliver gears as well successfully climb a rope efficiency and quickly.  In fact my design allows for the climber to run on the power of the drivetrain making in both efficient and substantially powerful.  My team is made up of future engineers but also future business majors and artists and doctors alike.  This is what made robotics different than every other team, it was a team in the true sense of the word.  It's a team made up of fourteen individuals, they write the budget and manage the books and they make the banner and serve as safety captain.  It is this team of individuals that are now competing as a whole.  As founder and captain I recruited the best mentors and got the schools backing financially however I learned the most when I was working with the girls to physically build and wire till the late hours of the night.  When something stopped working or a part malfunctioned it was the team that fixed it, as we would converse and reevaluate the situation.  We did not just build a robot we obtained new knowledge and new friends and a newfound determination for success.","I believe I should be selected for this program largely because I am a self- starter.  Aside from founding my own robotics team I have additionally started my own business.  Kickin'It is a mommy and me soccer program for toddlers that focuses on basics in both soccer and school alike.  I have successfully advertised my business through flyers and social media.  By strategically picking a location and price point my business is booming through word of mouth in local schools.  I also work as a cashier at a farm stand.  Upon my first day I was positioned as a bagger and told it took two years to become a cashier.  Not being contempt in my position I memorized every price in the market and every button on the cash register along with the scale on my first day.  I then proved myself to my manager on my second day and worked the cash register everyday and the entirety of Fourth of July weekend.  This is just one example of my initiative.  I also chose to apply to an academically accelerated school when I was in eighth grade when none of my friends were.  I now am enrolled in Our Lady of Mercy Academy where in my freshman year I took both honors algebra and chemistry and a computer science class.  Last year I was one of the only freshmen in my chemistry class and this year again I am one of only three sophomores in my physics class.  And for next year I am enrolled in anatomy and AP Computer Science where I will be the only junior.  I am also enrolled in robotics for next year, a new class being offered as a result of my team.  I have consistently chosen classes to prepare me for my major and have worked hard to create my own success.  From my robotics team, which has gotten so successful that I will be interviewed for a radio station to represent both FIRST Robotics and girls in STEM everywhere, to my booming business I have proven myself as a hard worker.  I believe I have much to learn from this program and view as it enormous opportunity.

",,I received the Algebra 2 math achievement award my freshmen year of high school for having the highest grade in that class and also for receiving a perfect score on my sol. ,,,"The Summer Residential Governor's School for Math Science and Technology was held at Lynchburg College in Lynchburg, Virginia. I lived in a dorm on campus for a month and took a  2-week long anatomy course called Body Quest and a month-long course on environmental science called Water, Water. In the Water, Water class, we focused mostly on rivers by taking field trips and testing their discharge and floodplains. In the Body Quest class, we learned the anatomy of many different animals and then dissected them to get a more hands-on approach to our learning. ","Most people’s response to this question would be about how much they love math and science. But I want to be an engineer because I love designing and learning about how things work. 
The past two summers I have had the privilege to travel to Orlando, Florida three times to enjoy my favorite place, Walt Disney World. Although this may sound just like a normal family vacation, it's actually a learning opportunity for me as I hope to pursue a career as an Imagineer, which is an engineer for Disney World. While my families favorite part of the parks are the rides and attractions, my favorite part is walking around and admiring the structures and creative layout around the parks. One of my favorite rides, Living With The Lands, is located in Epcot. It focuses on agriculture and how they have engineered better ways to mass produce food such as hydroponics and aquaponics. My time at Disney World is not only spent enjoying family time but also admiring the engineering and design of the parks.","I was selected along with seven other students to attend an engineering career fair at the Newport News shipyard. When we first got there, we walked around to different booths to talk with all different types of engineers and ask them any questions we had. We then got randomly assigned to groups and had to solve an engineering problem. I had to work with two random boys I had never met before. My groups problem was to make a boat out of only duct tape, that weighed the lightest yet held the most amount of weight. We designed our boat in a shape of a canoe, as we felt that it had enough surface area on the bottom to displace enough water to help it float and it also was small enough to use less duct tape, so it didn’t weigh as much. Our boat only weighed 40 grams yet it held nine pounds. We ended up winning second place! ","I should be selected to attend this program so I can expand my basic knowledge around engineering and technology. My high school does not currently offer any in-depth engineering classes, only general engineering studies. I currently take as many math and science classes that my high school offers, but am limited so I try to supplement with summer programs. 
I wish to continue to build off of my current engineering knowledge and continue to obtain an understanding of the different fields of engineering and technology, allowing me the opportunity to obtain employment in the field of study. I am hoping to pursue a career in the field of engineering, obtaining my Master’s degree and securing a position as an Imagineer with Disney. 
This past summer, I was selected, out of many Virginia high school applicants, to attend the Virginia’s Summer Residential Governor’s School for Math, Science, and Technology at Lynchburg College. This program was one of the best experiences of my life and provided me the opportunity to expand my knowledge even further than my high school classes. My classes offered many forms of hands on learning and in-field experiences, that helped me obtain more knowledge around environmental sciences. It provided me a glimpse into the college experience; allowing me to reside in a dorm room for a month, while also having current college professors teach the classes, as if they were teaching college students. This program gave me a chance to interact with students that have the same interests as I do and form strong friendships with people I still communicate with today. I hope to have these same experiences in the C-Tech program.","By checking this box, I am electronically signing this online application and acknowledging that the information I have provided is accurate to the best of my knowledge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They have always been really easy for me and I find them very interesting, so I have always enjoyed them. I love doing science experiments during class. I love figuring out how to do a difficult word problem in math. The second reason I want to be an engineer is that both of my parents are engineers. They are both good at math and science and I really look up to them and want to be like them. Also, they both enjoy their jobs and I want to find a job that I enjoy like I do. I believe that an engineering job, where I get to use a lot of math and science, would be a job that I would love. The third reason that I want to be an engineer is I like to build things and understand how they work. When I was a kid I would watch How It’s Made with my dad and I would always love to just learn how they made ordinary, everyday objects. One of my favorite shows is Mythbusters. I love to watch them work out how the replicate a scenario or figure out how to build something and see the satisfaction they get after the myth. I like to build with Legos because I like to be able to create something by myself and see a pile of random pieces come together and create something.","In my science class in the seventh grade, we had to build a vehicle and get it to go a certain distance using only a box fan. My partner and I worked on the project for a long time. We built the vehicle out of K’Nex, these toys that snap together so you can build things out of them. We used a bandana as a sail so that the vehicle would catch the wind and move forward. When we tested our vehicle out, though, it kept falling apart. We had to keep rebuilding it in different ways to try and make it stay together. Eventually, we managed to make the vehicle go forward without falling apart. Once we managed that, though, we couldn’t figure out how to make the vehicle go far enough with just the box fan. We had to keep the fan a certain distance from the vehicle’s starting point, so we couldn’t just move the fan closer. We moved the fan as close to the vehicle as we were allowed to and we made the sail as big as we were able to without making the whole vehicle collapse. Eventually, after making the sail as big as we could and taking off as much extra weight as we could, we were able to make the vehicle go just far enough to get us past the distance we needed to get the points. Then the day in class came. Our teacher told us we had three tries to make it to the set distance. On our first try, our vehicle turned to the right and hit the wall. On the second try, we made it past the set distance. On our third try to see if we could get it even farther, we almost made it to the set distance, but one of the wheels fell off. Even though our third attempt didn’t work, we still got an A because we made it past the set distance with our vehicle. I enjoyed this project because even though it was hard and didn’t do as well as I wanted, it was building something, and trying different things. I liked having a partner because we could talk about different ideas. She thought of things I didn’t, and I had different ideas too. ","I should be selected for this program for many reasons. While I know that I want to be an engineer, I still have a lot to learn about what engineering is, and what types of careers exist. I want to know more about the different types of engineering and how each of them differ from each other. I want to be able to figure out what type of engineer I want to be. By learning more now, I can pick the right type of engineering for my college major. I am a sophomore, so I still have time to explore. Spending time at Virginia Tech will also allow me to see what the school is like, more than I would get from a tour.

My sister went to a similar program last year and she really enjoyed it. She made friends and she learned a lot about engineering at that camp, and decided what type of engineer she wants to be. I think that I could have a similar experience at this camp, by making new friends and learning about engineering. This program will also give me experiences that will help make me a better engineer. I really enjoy building things, and this camp looks like it has hands on work, as well as hearing about different majors.

I have an inquisitive nature and I enjoy learning. I especially enjoy working in groups and hands-on activities. I believe that I will be able to experience all of these things at this camp.","By checking this box, I am electronically signing this online application and acknowledging that the information I have provided is accurate to the best of my knowledge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

","I have been involved with robotics since I was in elementary school. Right now I’m vice-president of my high school robotics club, and I love everything about it. I love brainstorming with my team and creating robot designs, and a lot of really bad jokes. Everyone’s ideas come together and make a solution that’s so much better than anything I would be able to come up with on my own. I love working with my hands and actually putting the robot together, and fixing the inevitable problems that we discover. The challenges and brainstorming to overcome them never really end, and I constantly have to think and innovate. Then, if we managed to overcome all the obstacles, we get to go to the competition and watch our robot do what it was made for. We know exactly how much time and effort and hope went into creating our robot, and when everything comes together and it succeeds it’s exhilarating. That’s why I want to be an engineer. I would get to do robotics all the time, and people would actually pay me to do it. In college I plan to major in either mechanical or aerospace engineering, and then after I graduate I want to work for NASA or SpaceX. Building robots that go into space and find things that no one has ever discovered before would be amazing. I also really want to be astronaut and go into space myself. Building probes and satellites in zero gravity is actually a lot more efficient, because it’s easier to move big parts and they don’t have to be able to escape Earth’s gravity. Living on the space station and building robots would be my dream job. After all, what’s a spaceship but a really big robot? ","My physics class had a miniature pumpkin chucking contest before Halloween. We split into groups to try to build a catapult out of cups, plastic spoons, rubber bands, tape, and Popsicle sticks that would throw our pumpkin peep the farthest and the highest. I had the original idea of how to mount the spoon between two cups and use the rubber bands to make a traditional catapult. Working together, my group improved that idea so we had two groups of rubber bands instead of just one providing tension against pulling the spoon back. More force on the spoon would make it come forward faster when we released it and launch the pumpkin peep with more energy. We had just finished practicing and were about to go outside for the start of the competition when one of our rubber bands snapped. The whole group had to work together to quickly replace the rubber band and put tape over the edge that had frayed it. If everyone hadn’t been involved and known how our catapult was built we wouldn’t have been able to do it. During the competition we realized that the angle of elevation of our catapult wasn’t high enough to get our pumpkin peep onto the roof that was the goal of the height contest. We tried pulling the spoon back farther, but that lessened the force and didn’t work. We couldn’t tilt the cups that made the catapult’s base because we needed a firm foundation to launch from. Finally we came up with the idea to use the shoe of one of the boys in my group. We put one edge of the cups on the shoe and kept the other edge on the ground and held the catapult down firmly while firing. This tilted the catapult and increased the angle of elevation. Using this solution we were able to launch our pumpkin peep onto the top of our school’s New Science building. ","I should be selected for this program because I have high goals. I want to work for NASA and be an astronaut, and I’m going to need all the preparation and experience I can get to qualify. This program would help me become a better engineer and be more likely to succeed. Engineering is a very male-dominated field, and knowing what being an engineer is like and being prepared for college would help me compete. People have started asking me seriously what college I want to go to, and I’m not able to answer them as well as I should. I have a few vague ideas, but I don’t have a definite plan. Virginia Tech is one of the colleges I’ve considered applying to, and this would help me decide whether I think it would be a good college for me. Staying on a college campus for two weeks would also give me an idea of what college life will be like, and help me be prepared and adjust faster when I go to college. Knowing more about the college application process would help me figure out where I’m going to apply. Finding out what companies are looking for when they hire engineers would help me get a job in the future and know more about what engineers do in specific fields. This program would be a great place to make new friends, too. There aren’t many places where you can find a lot of girls who are interested in engineering. It would be a unique opportunity to meet other girls who have the same interests as me. Most of the people on my robotics team are guys, and it would be nice to get to work with girls. I’ll probably end up going to the same college as some of them. Being selected for this program would make my summer a lot more fun and help me be better prepared for the future.","By checking this box, I am electronically signing this online application and acknowledging that the information I have provided is accurate to the best of my knowledge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

",Babysitting,"Physics Group; Being a Junior in AP Physics, some of my classmates and I formed a study group to help ensure our success in this College level course. We continually meet at our various homes and bounce ideas and thoughts off each other. I have found it to be an effective way to better understand the material.  ","I would like to be an engineer for a variety of reasons.  First of all my Father has a degree in Computer Science from GMU and my Uncle has an Electrical Engineering degree from VT (1989) so I have developed an interest in both fields at a very young age.  I enjoy troubleshooting computers and have a knack for electronics and gismos.  Furthermore, I have always enjoyed Math and Science classes in school and find them interesting and rewarding.  In Math, I have come to realize that if I memorize the formulas, I can solve any problems.   I have received an “A” in all my Math classes since 1st grade.  I’m looking forward to taking more challenging math classes up to BC Calculus. My Grandfather was also an Aeronautical Engineer a long time ago.  He attended Massachusetts Institute of Technology and went on to secure a number of patents.  ","I helped my dad with setting up our home network to include cable modem, router, Norton anti-virus, and a wireless printer.  I also helped my dad with the setup of our home theatre system to include the installation of the front projector on the ceiling, mounting of the projector screen and the wiring all the components.  It is a very rewarding experience to watch movies on a system I help set up.   I have also helped my Dad and Uncle around the house with installing new light switches with dimmers, 3-way switches, GFCI outlets etc.  They have both taught me that a technical degree comes in handy around the house and that they’re always willing to attempt to fix or replace any electronic device around the house.  ","Given my Family’s background, I would love the opportunity to pursue a degree in Computer Engineering since it would be a combination of both Computers and Engineering.  Computer Engineer jobs have grown in demand during this digital age since it combines not only electrical engineering and software design but also hardware/software integration.  Internet Security is an area that fascinates me.  Hackers are constantly looking for ways to compromise networks and Computer Engineers are always developing code to safeguard networks, a game of cat and mouse.  If I was selected to attend this program, I would look forward to living in a College Dorm and eating in your amazing dining halls.  I would also look forward to experiencing how a College class is taught and how much homework is given every night.  After two weeks of attending class every day, it will provide me a better idea of what an Engineering course load would be like. I also attended a VT information session last month and fell in love with the campus.  In closing, I hope I am provided an opportunity to attend this program given my strong Math and Science background, my Family history in this field, and my personal desire to ultimately become a Computer Engineer.","By checking this box, I am electronically signing this online application and acknowledging that the information I have provided is accurate to the best of my knowledge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This program, designed by the Virginia Space Grant Consortium (VSGC), inspires students who possess technical and/or scientific interests and are motivated to learn about the many different opportunities that NASA offers. The program features two key elements. The first is an on-line science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) learning experience featuring five modules. These modules included projects to learn about aerodynamics, buoyancy, and the laws of motion.  I created an airplane wing, a model airplane, a balloon with a basket for a buoyancy experiment, and virtual water rocket. Upon completion of the online program, top performing scholars were invited to attend a seven-day residential Summer Academy at NASA Wallops Flight Facility on Wallops Island, VA, where scholars learned first-hand from NASA professionals and their partners about the latest, cutting edge technologies and missions.  During the week-long academy at Wallops Island, I was chosen to be on the scientific balloon team.  We designed a mission using a high altitude balloon and a high powered telescope to investigate a distant galaxy.  The numerous other challenges we studied included creating a hydraulic arm from limited supplies, an edible bridge, made of marshmallows, Graham Crackers, and chocolate, and a rocket design challenge to see which rocket design could launch the most weight.  ","When I was younger, one of my favorite activities was going to the airport to pick up my dad when he traveled for his job.  It wasn’t just that I was happy to see him, but we would park by the fence and watch planes take off and land at the Norfolk International Airport.  I was hooked on seeing those planes come and go.  It was very exciting to me, and I asked to go and watch every time I could.  It became a regular Sunday activity for many years.  As I grew up, I enjoyed finding out more about how the airplanes worked and how they were made.  I also was curious if it was possible to make spacecraft that could travel away from the Earth with humans on the spacecraft, even traveling to the moon or other planets in the solar system.  Since I live close to the Virginia Air and Space Center, I have visited it many times.  I have read about all the different types of rockets and how they are used in space flight.  Meeting and talking with the NASA engineers at VSCS only increased my excitement about the possibility of working in this field.
My fascination with all types of ‘flying machines’ continues today, and I intend to pursue an engineering field in college.  I have always excelled in and enjoyed my math and science classes in school, and I love problem solving.  My parents have been very supportive of my love of learning.  My dad is an engineer, and my mom is a doctor, so they understand the need for my continuing education, but they also understand that I need to follow my own dreams.  
I want to have a career where I can use my love for math and science to solve difficult problems, and to develop new and better solutions to the challenges we face today.  I believe that engineering is the field where I will be able to continuously challenge myself, and that I will enjoy the search for solutions to difficult and important technical challenges and problems.","While I was at the Wallops Island VSCS summer academy, one of our assignments was to create a mission plan to be conducted by NASA.  Our team of students decided to send a spacecraft to study a comet.  As we worked on the project, the team determined that there were several significant flaws in our plan that we could not overcome.  However, we had less than two days remaining to complete the entire project and be ready to present our mission plan to our peers and to the NASA team.  Once we reached the point where there were several critical reasons why our chosen mission would not work, not everyone agreed that changing was the best option.  We had to persuade some members that a mission that is not viable isn’t worth pursuing. 
The whole team worked very hard throughout the night researching and coming up with a new, solid mission.  Everyone worked together to find the flaws and fix them.  Our new mission, Spectrometric and Interferometric Telescope for Age of Star Clusters in the Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy, was a mission to explore a distant galaxy using a large telescope taken to high altitude using a scientific balloon.  During our practice presentation, the audience was amazed with how much work we had done in a short period of time.  That was the nicest compliment the group had received because we did not expect the mission to turn out as well as it did.  During the final presentation, in front of NASA staff and faculty, many questions were asked, but our team had valid answers to every question.  An audience member, who was actually part of the NASA scientific balloon team staff, was very impressed with our work effort and our mission.
None of my teammates were happy that we changed our mission.  The new mission had a completely new set of problems and challenges, but our team worked hard to develop a mission plan that had a solid foundation, and no critical flaws that would prevent the mission from working and being a viable NASA mission.","When I was growing up, my favorite question was “Why.”  These were some of my favorites: Why does the bird keep flying without flapping his wings?  Why does that tunnel support the trains even though it is almost 100 years old?   Instead of just asking the question, I want to be able discover the answers to more difficult questions.
My favorite subjects in school are math and science.  I enjoy science because it is interesting and there is always something new to discover.  Mathematics is exciting because the logic and reasoning is easy to me.  Engineering is the application of science and mathematics, and some of my favorite experiences have involved hands-on experimentation involving these subjects.   My love of solving puzzles when I was younger benefits me now.  I am interested in exploring applications of engineering and the hands-on activities that this program will offer.  I am a hard worker, very inquisitive, and kind to everyone.  When I am chosen to participate in the C-Tech2 program, I will learn more and have more hands on experience with the engineering field.  I am excited to meet the industry representatives to learn about real world opportunities.
As a result of attending the recent open house for high school juniors at Virginia Tech, I have become excited about the possibility of attending college there.  Since I live in Chesapeake Virginia, I have not had a lot of exposure to Virginia Tech, and what it offers.  The C-Tech2 program is a wonderful opportunity to learn more about Virginia Tech, as well as learning more about the wide variety engineering disciplines, and to be able to work with other high school students with interests and abilities similar to my own.  I am very excited about the opportunity to spend two weeks participating in the C-Tech2 program and learning from the university staff, college students, and other high school students.","By checking this box, I am electronically signing this online application and acknowledging that the information I have provided is accurate to the best of my knowledge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I had wanted to be a doctor or a veterinarian, some profession that had an immediate and lasting effect on society and my character. As I grew up, all of my interests changed except for one- the desire to help people. Holding on to this one factor, I was left searching for the right college major and my next step in life until last year. At my school, there was a talk with a college professor about biomedical engineering, and I went to hear her speak. This moment is when I realized engineers help people every day and we do not always realize this. Looking around inside our homes, on our daily commutes to work, and even beyond our planet, engineers are discovering new ways to benefit our everyday lives, and I want to become a part of it.
In the future, I want to challenge myself in a profession and use my knowledge to uniquely solve problems. Working with others to accomplish a goal, I wish to create something innovative that motivates people of all ages and makes them think twice about our limits. I want to take the information I have learned, expand upon it, and apply it to the real world by completing projects. Our tomorrow is changing to a smarter, more efficient place, inspiring the creation of new ideas. My future is full of teamwork, knowledge, and innovation, but the underlying factor is the aspiration to influence people’s lives for the better. With this newfound passion of engineering, I hope to make people’s dreams, large and small, come true.","In my physics class earlier this year, a classmate and I had to design a structure that would safely land an egg dropped from the top of our school’s football bleachers. With limitations on size and materials, my partner and I put our minds together to create a paper box unlike anyone else’s designs. Having never worked together before, we had to discuss where our ideas came from and find a way to fit possible elements together into a seamless, cohesive design. My partner suggested that we create a box that would lessen the impact of the harsh landing, but didn’t know how. After minutes of brainstorming, I thought of rolling paper into tiny tubes, then taping the tubes in a row to make a side of the box. The paper tube sides would take more impact of the sudden landing than a sheet of paper as a side. We agreed on the idea as we started rolling and taping paper to create the six sides of a cube.
	As soon as the box was finished, we started planning ahead for next period and decided what materials to bring in to cushion the egg. With the assignment’s limitations, we knew that the softer and more elastic the materials were, there was a greater chance of the egg “surviving” the drop. The next day, we brought in every item we could find that would effectively stop the egg, from tiny balloons to pillow stuffing. There could be no test trials, so we had to gauge what would slow the egg’s momentum with each of the items. We stuffed the paper tube box with foam, sponges, and pillow stuffing, to name a few items. My partner and I waited with butterflies in our stomachs when the time came to drop the egg, and when the box landed, the impact sounded lighter than the other teams’ designs. Opening the box, the egg did not break or crack, and we earned ourselves an A on the project. The egg alone didn’t earn us an A, but our teamwork, communication, trust, and collaboration is what made the lab so successful.","I should be selected to the C-Tech² program because I am strong academically and personally. I am persistent through tricky situations inside and outside of school, and I stay determined when I face life’s problems. I can communicate with others well; together my partners and I can solve many problems when we put our heads together. I have a great attention to detail and care about every tiny word I write or think. When looking at two paths, I take the tougher yet more rewarding route. Every opportunity that comes my way I take, leaving me a stronger and more informed person. This program will also pave the road for my future path in college by giving me a sense of what circumstances are to come in a few years. I can translate classroom lessons to hands-on experiences, and get an idea of the heart of engineering. By participating and interacting with others, I can challenge myself and discover my true interests and talents. Using a basic math and science background, I can see my years of hard work paying off in a series of real-life applications.
	Virginia Tech is on the top of my list of schools as a rising senior. I had always been interested in Virginia Tech, but I was drawn in more when I visited the campus in the Hokie Preview: Junior Open House recently. The motto of Ut Prosim spoke to me, plus the students here are very passionate and dedicated to their majors and school. The atmosphere made me feel at home when I visited, and I want to grow as a person knowing that a college matches my morals. Being a prospective student, I will benefit by learning in Virginia Tech’s labs and pre-engineering curriculum. C-Tech² will teach me new skills while being immersed in a college environment. With my personality, skills, and potential, I believe I am a perfect fit for the C-Tech² program.","By checking this box, I am electronically signing this online application and acknowledging that the information I have provided is accurate to the best of my knowledge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AP Scholars, 2014-present.",,,"Since I was little, I have enjoyed discovering new technology and loved to get the new Apple products as soon as they would come out. It always interested me to learn how technology worked. I would help people like my older sister, my parents, and my grandparents to fix their electronics. Then, when I became a high school student, I took chemistry and ended up enjoying it a lot. Currently, I am taking physics and enjoy it even more than chemistry. I realized I liked these two subjects because they involved both science and math. Last year, I combined my love of technology with my love of entrepreneurship when I tried to start my own business through the Young Entrepreneurs' Academy. My business idea was an app that would track the Arlington County Public School (APS) buses to help parents and students see the location of their bus. This could be used if a student was running late or if the bus was running late. I developed a prototype, received start-up investment from a local business leader, and set up a one-on-one meeting with the head of technology for APS. But APS was concerned with having the location of their buses be known, so they did not release the information to me. From looking at all my interests, which are entrepreneurship, science, and math, I realized engineering was perfect for me. The excitement of putting all my interests together to discover and create new things that will help the world is something I look forward to. In addition, I have always loved to help people, whether it is  helping to show my grandparents how to send an email or helping the homeless or our high school janitors through the chemistry of baking treats or making flapjacks. Engineering is meant to help people and in a much bigger way than I have so far. To be a part of a field that allows me to be creative and use all my knowledge to potentially create something new that will help a lot of people is something I look forward to doing in my future.","In the summer of 2015, I had the opportunity to go to Costa Rica for a community service trip in which other teens and I would help by doing projects chosen by the local community. We were assigned to small groups and had only 5 days to complete a project. My group was assigned to help a day care by installing sand under the playground. This was very important for the kids because, up until that time,  before they would fall off the playground equipment and onto cement, which would hurt them. After installing the sand, we also built a border out of tires and painted them to make sure the sand would stay in place when the kids played on it. As a team, we shared positions or helped each other when we needed it, which allowed us to end up finishing the project in 2 days. Since we finished, they assigned us a new project the next day to help clean up the beach. We all split up and picked up as much as we could, which ended up making the beach look better than ever. Just in one day, we worked together to accomplish so much. We had finished these 2 projects so fast that the community asked us to do another one for the last 2 days we were there.  This time, we were assigned to use rocks and dirt in a small area in a high school and create benches for the students to be able to sit. We took turns making cement, cleaning the area, and putting the cement in blocks to build. As a team, we ended up getting most of the cement ready, but only had time to build one bench. In the long run, we got a lot done because the cement we had made could easily be used for the next group to finish the benches. As a team, we worked together to help the community and make their lives a little better. Since we all were willing to help each other out when needed, our group was able to work efficiently and help solve problems identified by the community in more ways than we thought possible.","I have participated in two programs that were intended to help me explore engineering, but I have not been able to truly feel like I was getting a meaningful engineering experience through these programs. One program was sponsored by the Society of Women in Engineering (SWE), and it was held for one day at the University of Virginia. At this program, they tried to help high school girls like myself to explore the different types of engineering. Since it was only a one-day program, we could not deeply explore or see what it was like in each field, so I did not get a good feel of what engineering is like or what I would want to do  within it. In addition, I attend a program called Girls in Technology (GIT) that is held once a month at a Microsoft facility about 40 minutes from my home. This program is intended to help girls discover different STEM careers and to meet working women in STEM fields. But, just like the SWE program, GIT provide only a brief exposure to each career, so I have not been able to tell what I would enjoy to do within the STEM fields. I think the C-Tech2 program would be perfect for me, because I can finally have an opportunity to explore my true passion within engineering in a more in-depth way. I am a very outgoing person, I like to work in teams, and think I would bring a lot of excitement to the program, while of course being serious about my work. I am also very motivated to show my passion towards engineering and work hard during the program to make the best out of it. I am eager to learn and to solve problems, while enjoying this great summer experience and meeting girls that have the same interests as I do.","By checking this box, I am electronically signing this online application and acknowledging that the information I have provided is accurate to the best of my knowledge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TSA Club- 2015-2017",,,"There are several reasons why I plan to be an engineer.  At a very early age I showed a strong aptitude for mathematics.  Based on my grades and SOL scores, I was placed in an advanced math track in middle school.  As a sophomore, I took two math classes and I am currently taking AP Calculus BC as a junior.  Even when I was in elementary school, teachers suggested that I go into a STEM field because of my achievements in math.  When I was in seventh grade, a parent spoke to my technical education class about civil engineering.  This sparked my interest in engineering.  My freshman year, I took a test in school that suggested possible careers based on your skills and interests; engineering was one of my top results.  My family moved between my freshman and sophomore year.  My new school has an extensive engineering program.  I took Technical Drawing my first semester of sophomore year and was quickly promoted to Advanced Technical Drawing.  Only a few students moved up.  This was my first exposure to doing any classwork related to engineering and it made me sure that I wanted to be an engineer.  In my class, I used the program AutoCAD, which I learned very quickly.  This class also opened my mind to other fields of engineering.  I am currently taking an engineering class called iSTEM. This class required an application and out of all of the applicants, only one-third of the students who applied were chosen to be in the class. It brings together different mathematic and scientific skills and applies them to engineering and problem solving.  Finally, I would like to be an engineer because engineers are an extremely important part of society.  I want my career to be part of something that helps humanity.","Throughout this year, I have been working with a team of seven students in my iSTEM class.  Our project has been building a submersible.  The problem or goal of this project has been to design a sub that can perform specific tasks in the water. The submersible we designed has six motors/propellers, two tubes, one containing the battery and the other containing the electronics, a camera, two lights, and a tether.  We also used a 3-D printer to create certain components of the submersible.  It is maneuvered with an X-Box remote controller, which is connected to a computer. We have spent these past six months conducting research, creating a product structure and manual, and building and testing the sub.  We have been testing our sub in a tub full of water and at the local indoor pool, and later we will be taking the sub to a local lake.   I have learned many new engineering skills such as how to construct a product structure and a proper manual.  As a team, we have all learned to build from our mistakes and not to get upset about something when it doesn’t work.  For example, when we finished epoxying and soldering our lights for the sub, we discovered there was a leak.  It took over a month to discover what was causing the lights to leak, and in multiple rounds of problem solving to discover where the leak was coming from.   Everybody on my team has a specific job; mine is project manager.  As project manager, it is my job to have a full understanding of what it is that everybody else on my team is doing.  While I already have experience as being a leader, I look forward to becoming more of a leader and solving problems at the C-Tech2 program.","I am a strong candidate for the C-Tech2 engineering program. I have already developed leadership skills that will make me an asset to this camp.  This year I have been elected to a new leadership position.  I am the secretary of the Technology Student Association (TSA).  I document everything that happens at both general meetings and executive council meetings; I also help plan for each of the general meetings.  Next year, I plan to be elected president of TSA.  Being an officer of TSA has taught to me speak up when I have an idea and has made me more assertive.  I don’t shy away from voicing my opinion.  This is another quality that would make me a valuable part of the camp.  I have a very strong love and enthusiasm for engineering.  Everyday I look forward to going to my iSTEM class because I know that there will be a new problem that needs to be solved.  Nothing excites me more than collaborating with my teammates to figure out ways to solve problems.  I always find myself thinking about the future whenever we discover something new or have an accomplishment.  On top of my personal accomplishments that qualify me for this program, I am also a high achieving young woman.  The field of engineering needs smart, motivated women like me.  This field still has a gender gap that must be overcome.  Overall, I find that I would be a great addition to the C-Tech2 camp because of my leadership qualities and determination to be an engineer.

     RVAMEP is a three week summer camp where participants learn about the different fields of engineering, create projects, build, program, learn coding, and meet with mentors. ","	I am interested in engineering because it’s a field that is lacking minorities and women. I’ve always liked science and math. I like the idea of inventing or improving products for the world. I’ve participated in the Junior Academy of Science, in which I wrote research papers and presented my experiments to judges. My experiments consisted of building and testing bridges, and testing the pH of compost and its effect on biodegradable products. In the Richmond Minorities in Engineering summer camp program, I learned how to code, build planes, catapults, and roller coasters. It sparked my love for STEM because I was able to talk to professionals about their jobs, and all of the fascinating discoveries they’re making. I toured the VCU engineering building. I got to see how they inspect cancer cells, lasers, microscopes, and research labs. I would like to work in biomedical engineering because I like the medicine component, and creating equipment to be used for improving the health of others. In addition, I’m interested in research science. I like conducting research, writing, and learning new things. I can conduct experiments, and publish my findings for other people to see. I’m also interested in psychology. Even though psychology is not engineering, it is still a part of STEM. I love learning about the brain and motivation for our behaviors. By learning about psychology, I have become interested in neuroscience. A STEM professional came to our school, and she inspired me because she captivated the audience with the challenges she faced in her job, and the fact that she’s an educator as well. Engineering is a way for me to give back to the community, and to bring more minorities into the workplace.","     I faced many challenges while working in a group to put on the Black History Month school assembly. Last year’s assembly did not go as well, so this year the Barrier Breakers Club was able to produce the assembly. I volunteered to make the video because I am skilled in filming, video editing, and had a vision for what I wanted the film to be about. I was inspired by the movie, “Hidden Figures,” and wanted to the name the video Hidden STEM Figures. I interviewed students about inventions made by African Americans, why we should celebrate Black History Month, and would they be more interested in STEM if more African Americans were depicted in it. I was only supposed to edit the video, and the other group members were supposed to conduct the interviews. I ended up not getting any conducted interviews, so I had to interview everyone myself. I interviewed over fifty teachers and students from different grades, genders, and races to display diversity. After I conducted the interview, I had to edit, narrate, and find the right music for the video. I decided to compromise with the group. They decided they would give presentations on different African Americans in STEM, and I could make the video. It was difficult to make the video as I had to get it approved by many teachers and administrators. Different people looked it over, and revised the message because it represents the black population at Glen Allen. I worked with the technology team as well to do audio and lighting checks. The student body was impressed by the video, and learned that African Americans created products they use every day. The presentation went really well, and I’m glad I worked with the team to create such an impressive assembly! ","     I should be selected for this program because I want to gain knowledge about engineering that I can use when I pursue a job in the field. I take on a leadership role, and work well in groups. I am skilled in research and technology as well. I want to gain new skills that I can share with other students, and with the other minorities in the Diverse Helping Hands Club. I want to experience college life, and see the Virginia Tech Campus. I will bring a new perspective and a determined attitude to this program. I love to solve problems and set goals, which is what engineering is all about. I want to attend seminars and hear from mentors. I am excited to participate in activities and meet new people. I want to explore the different field of engineering more in depth, and create a final project to reflect on what I’ve learned. I can also share the knowledge and techniques I will learn with the, “Leader in Me Foundation,” at Brooklyn Middle School. Currently, I am organizing donations for their foundation, and I will begin mentoring the children in the program. I will be able to teach them what I’ve learned about STEM, and facilitate problem-solving and teamwork. In addition, it would be a privilege to learn from the educators at the program at such a prestigious and well-known university. Summer camps like this, inspire me to want to do well during the school year, and help enhance my learning by giving me new skills to bring to the next year. I should be selected for this program because I am intrinsically motivated to learn about engineering, and to create a solid foundation in STEM to enrich my future.

National Art Honor Society, 2014-2017",,,"I want to be an engineer so I will be able to change the world. I want to be a part of projects that will make an impact. My absolute dream job is to work for NASA and be an aerospace engineer, because NASA is a place where its scientists and engineers are paving new paths in its field. Whenever I watch movies like Apollo 13 or Hidden Figures I get so inspired by all of the people who are behind each project. Most people do not even know how many people it took for each project, and many of those people who were behind these projects, big or small, never get recognized. But the amazing thing is, the scientists and engineers, not just at NASA but at most other companies too, don’t do what they do to be recognized or become well-known. They do it because it’s their job and they love it. They spend hours researching and building and calculating and recalculating simply because they care that much. I want to be an engineer, not because I’ll eventually need a job, but because I love it.","I work in the after school child care department at the YMCA near my house every day after school. Each day we are supposed to have a planned STEM or art activity for the kids to do, but lately the administration team at the Y has been planning activities that either don’t apply to the age group of our students (K-5th grades) or they don’t send us the supplies needed for the activity. This is mainly because the activities they plan are sent to many, many different YMCA branches, and the team has to try to cater to all of us. The way the schedule is set up, the class of Kindergarten and First Graders that I teach does the activity first.  So my co-counselor and I are the first to realize that the activity is not ready, or the we can’t do it with the time and resources we have. That means that she and I have only around five minutes during our class’s transition from gym time and activity time to either change up the planned activity or to come up with our own activity. For example, last week the activity the administration had planned was called “Lava Flow” and the general idea for the activity was for the whole class to stand on a sheet of plastic and try to get across the classroom without anyone getting off the sheet or touching the floor, or the “lava.” Because we didn’t have a plastic sheet, we had to find another activity to do. So my co-counselor and I changed the activity to apply better to our age group and to accommodate the fact that we did not have plastic sheets readily available. The new “Lava Flow” activity was for each child to get a single piece of paper and to try to get from one tape line on the floor to the other side of the room, by standing on each piece of paper as a sort of raft. The trick was for the whole class to communicate and work together to put the rafts on the floor in a way that everyone was able to cross the river. I really enjoy the challenge of coming up with idea on the spot everyday.","As soon as I heard about this program I became excited for the opportunity to jump start my engineering career.  Both my father and grandfather are mechanical engineers and our family takes great pride in this profession.  Attending Virginia Tech is something I have always wanted to do, and this program will start me on the path to making this dream a reality.  This program allows women with similar interests the chance get together and support each other, while expanding our passion for engineering.

I chose to take Algebra Review, Rocketry, and Land, Air, and Sea Naviagtion.","    My first exposure to engineering was a rocketry class at a summer camp. We had a competition to build a rocket designed from a straw, some clay, and some paper. We used an air pump to launch them. I did not know the physics behind what I was doing, but I tried to do my best and account for the weight of both ends of the rocket. y rocket won by going the furthest distance. This sparked my interest in engineering. 
    The next year, I took a class called Land, Air, and Sea Navigation. We discussed the structure of boats, planes, and cars. We built small plastic planes and tin foil boats. We had competitions on whose plane had the longest air time and whose boat could hold the most weight. These experiences furthered my interest in this field because of how fascinated I was with how these vehicles were built and why.
    I believe engineering is a good fit for me because I love to learn how things work. I enjoy brainstorming and finding the best possible way to go about doing a project. In eighth grade, we were required to do a Rube Goldberg project. This required a lot of time and thought process. After a few instances of trial and error, we ended up with an eight step system, of simple machines, that filled a bowl with dog food.  
    Engineering seems to fit the subject area of which I thrive. My best subjects are math and science courses. These classes always have my attention and interest, which is why I am able to do so well in them. In my years as a cheerleader, my coach would ask me to help with the routine. We would have trouble getting stunts to work and she would ask for me to figure out what we should do. She said I was analytical and she needed my mind to help her figure out what to do. I enjoy analyzing problems and developing solutions. I have a strong interest in math and science and enjoy applying scientific concepts to solve problems. It is rewarding to manipulate physical processes to accomplish a task. I aspire to be a successful engineer.","
This year my school is putting on the show Beauty and the Beast. The cast builds the set. One task I was assigned, with a few others, was to make giant utensils. We brainstormed to determine the best way to make these. We tried to draw them by eye, looking at a model. Since none of us are great artists, this did not work well. We finally thought to use a projector to show the shadow of the utensils on the piece of wood. We had to adjust the thickness of the handles without making them out of proportion. We worked together to decide what looked best, and after we were all satisfied by our tracings, we cut them out with a jigsaw. We decided it would be the most efficient to clamp a few sheets of plywood together and to just cut once. We all helped in this task by holding the wood steady and helping to direct the person using the saw. This worked well, and we all were satisfied with our hard work. 
    This show must be put together in less than three months. We have to work hard to get all of our lines and blocking memorized. When a large number of cast members are not needed on stage, we go to a certain room to practice our dances and run through lines with each other. This helps us, as a group, decide on what we need to work. We also help each other to remember our parts and polish on the quality of our performance. 
    Each member of the cast is required to have sixteen hours of working on the set. We have work days where we all come to help. Our teacher has a list of tasks he needs accomplished, and he assigns us all things to do. We work in groups to do tasks such as painting, building structures, texturing, and finding ideas for costumes. This helps us to get to know the cast better and learn to work together. We ask for opinions on how to go about building structures or which method of painting would turn out best. The whole experience of our school musical is a time of bonding with new friends and learning.
","
    I believe I should be accepted into this summer program to help decide if engineering is a career I want to pursue. This will help tremendously with my search for colleges. Growing up, I always wanted to attend Virginia Tech, and this could help me decide whether or not it would be a good fit for me. 
    I am fairly certain that engineering is the career I want to pursue, but I can never know until I have some hands on experience on what it would entail. This camp could provide the information I need to decide if this is the field I want to pursue. This program would also give me some background knowledge in the engineering discipline I will choose. My top choices are to go into aeronautical engineering or ocean engineering. I need to decide if I should specialize in one specific field or if I should go into mechanical engineering. This camp would expand my knowledge on the fields I have to choose from and which is most suitable for me. 
 I would do well at this camp because of my performance in my STEM classes. I do well in both math and science, but I have a stronger vantage in my math classes. This year I am taking honors chemistry, geometry, and algebra two. This is a heavy course load with a large amount of work, but I still manage to keep my grades high. I even have a little competition with my friends for the highest grades. 
    This workload can be hard to manage with my extracurricular activities. I am a part of my school’s chamber choir, the school musical, and was recently selected for the Alabama All State Choir. These require me to work with large groups of classmates. This will help me, if I am accepted, to work together with my new friends at this camp. The experience of spending two weeks on campus with all new faces will give me a taste of what college life is like. I will be able to learn my way around the campus and find new groups of people with which I have dreams in common. I may even see some of these girls again if we attend VT.","By checking this box, I am electronically signing this online application and acknowledging that the information I have provided is accurate to the best of my knowledge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

			Why I want to be a successful engineer
	I want to be an engineer because they help out everyone. The world needs more female   engineers because it would show how it is not only a man’s job. I love working on things, building things; I really want to help build machines for the medical field one day. Engineers are also important in everyday use they manufactured our cars, yes of course but what about the small things. An example would be children toys, the machine does it but how did that machine get build. The answer is through the help of designers, computer programmers, the engineers build this machine. 
	If I was to become and engineer in the medical field I would be glad. I would be building machines to save someone else’s life, loved one, maybe my own mother. It has always been told do not pick a career that you are unsatisfied instead pick something that is going to last you a lifetime.

1/30/17 			Basketball problems 101
	My school does not have sports therefore; I have to play off campus. It was my tenth grade year I was playing basketball with the South City Knights, a recreational club. There was one basketball game that I will never forget it was one eventful nights. First my coach Ms. Amanda had to pick up five girls, she had came and got me after she got her daughter from school. Then we continued down southeast to pick everyone else up. Once we got everyone we headed down to Botetourt to the middle school to play against the county girls. While we were going down the road getting close to the stoplight off of Roanoke Road a man was speeding down the wrong lady and could have cause a head on collision but my coach had swerve over a little. By the grace of God there was no one in the other lane. 
When we arrive at the school we began to warm up after taking all the jewelry off, getting water, and switching our jersey over to the home team. We began to play we are barely through the first half and my teammates and the other team teammate’s began to foul each other real hard. They are leading the scoreboard with us catching up behind them; everyone is calling each other names. Our coach called time-out, and she asked us how we can handle the situation the right way without being aggressive. I said play better defense don’t be pushing, do not let them calling you names get your attention. Basically I was telling them to keep their heads in the game. That did not last long before the end of the game a fight broke out that cause one of our team mates to get a concussion. So we had to call the ambulance, and I help by telling the other team good game. I also made sure that my  teammate was okay by giving her water, and making sure that she did not hit her head on the concreate to make the matters worse.  That is what I did to help out my team.

					            Consideration
	There are several reasons I believe why I should go to C-Tech two. In my ninth grade year I went to Virginia Tech to do the Building Leaders for Advancing Science and Technology. I learned how to dissect an engine, which was really fun to do. Another fun project I liked was the team hands on activities like the marshmallow challenge. I always enjoy doing Stem camps or even the classes, because I really love science and technology. Science has always been my favorite subject through out school; I have a strong passion for research science. Every time my teacher assigned us a research paper, I would start right then instead of procrastinating. In everything I do I always try to do my best, it takes hard work and dedication. 
	Another factor is that I am always trying to find out about the new technology. There is always something new in the technology field, and if you don’t pay attention it could hurt you in a big way. For instance, a lot of businesses small or big are getting hurt because a lot of people shop online now. Instead of people going to malls or small clothing stores, they can access the same merchandise off the computer. Or think about the people who are use to old school job applications now force a new method of applying to jobs.  
The very last thing is that I really want to learn all I can. So in my future career I can remember my experience in the past to help solve a solution in the future. All I can say now is thank for listening to why I should be in this program.

The camp is for children that are rising into grades k-9.  This camp allows each child to experience print making, digital media, sculptures, painting, drawing, book making, etc. The Creative Arts Day Camp provides each student with the opportunity express themselves through innovative art making.","Walking through life I’ve recognized many flaws within our developing society. I’ve found myself evaluating how thoughtful contributions can go a long way in improving our daily lives. There are so many solutions to the limitations our society faces, but it takes an individual who can apply their analytical, creative, and practical intelligence to devise these advancements. When addressing an issue I’ve find myself using all my resources to approach and resolve this problem. Constructing items anew has always appealed to my interests. This has started from a young age in which I would refuse to look at instruction manuals, because I felt inclined to figure out what to do through analytical, creative, and practical applications. Engineers are the key to technological advancement and can use their resourcefulness to aid in medical breakthroughs. I am eager to make a difference in society’s progression, whether I help create the world’s next time machine or a children’s toy, my ambitions are high.","Biology can be a confusing subject for many people, these circumstances make it difficult to accomplish a group task when everyone is not on the same page. This occurred in my group of four when working on a Biology lab. Tensions began to rise and the group began to slowly fall behind everyone else. Conflict followed as a result of a lack of contribution from some members and the group conforming to majority perspective. This caused a divide in the group and lack of trust for one another, slowing our work. Naturally, a leader always emerges among a group. In this circumstance this person was myself. In order to bring together my group members I encouraged them to arrange a group brainstorming so that we could all contribute our ideas. I divided up responsibilities for each group member and encouraged each member to focus on the task where their strengths lied. Slowly but surely, my group began to work rhythmically and in sync. I found that it was easier to “divide and conquer” the group rather than all work on the same aspect of the lab. Each member was able to take accountability for specific tasks and communicate as a unit. By the end of the class period our team was working effectively and we developed a sense of  trust and respect for each other. Communication is an important aspect of  teamwork, ultimately this allowed us to complete our assignment. Together we were able to problem solve and multitask to develop a consistent way to approach our projects successfully.","I am excited to engross myself into this world of conception and innovation. I am able to gain but so much depth of these studies from my own research, but this program will allow me to gather insight into a deeper exploration of engineering. Seeing that Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University is my top college choice, I would like to explore engineering through the perspective of this institute and familiarize myself with the culture as well. I am aware that engineering is not a walk in the park, but I enjoy challenges. For this reason, I joined the international baccalaureate program at my High School. I look for opportunities to grow from experiences and meet new people. Thus, I recently created a club in my school called the “Diversity” club. This club is a representation of all cultures and brings together the community. I’m bringing to life the goals that were once just a figure of my imagination. That is what engineering is all about, constructing what is originally just a prospect. These are little advancements that I’m making to contribute towards the community and with the proper guidance I believe that I can fabricate anything I put my mind to.","By checking this box, I am electronically signing this online application and acknowledging that the information I have provided is accurate to the best of my knowledge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NC State: Girls Code and Create!, NC State Raleigh, NC, A camp for girls who wanted to learn the basics of coding. We started off using a program called SNAP and then proceed to create our own game. ","I want to be an engineer due to my love for STEM, and more specifically because of my interest in math and engineering. I first became interested in the STEM fields when I attended a coding camp at NC State. There we used an online coding program to create things like videos and even games that could be played on the computer and be downloaded on your phone. As I gain a deeper understanding of these fields I am realizing their importance in society to survive. There are so many things that we do every day that involve science, technology, engineering, and math, and is used in everything from gaming to business. I had the opportunity to attend a Gaming & IT Expo last fall. This was exciting for me because I was able to talk to some of the IT professionals and researchers that were involved in creating things that would help people lead better lives. This expo showed me all the different things you can do within engineering. I feel that by becoming an engineer I can help change the world and people around me for the better. There are not many women in the engineering field and I hope to change that by becoming one and inspiring other girls around me. By becoming an engineer I will be able to do something that I love for the rest of my life.","I participate in a college readiness program outside of school, and last year, my fellow classmates at the Emily Krzyzewski Center and I started a community service club. We were divided into three groups and given approximately two weeks to come up with a proposal for the club. During these two weeks we encountered many problems such as how to organize the club, efficient ways to keep things going, and effective ways to publicize our activities and recruit volunteers. As a team we worked together to conquer all of these problems by listing out all of the possible solutions and determining which one would work best. While working as a team I discovered that lots of times there is not only one correct way to solve a problem and even that sometimes the best solution is a combination of multiple solutions. Working as a team to solve a problem taught me how to break complex tasks into parts and steps and improve my communication skills. Another challenge was getting everyone to agree on one thing. We found it extremely difficult to come to a consensus because everyone was more willing to argue over why our idea was better rather than try to merge all the ideas together. From this experience I learned the power of communication and the importance of listening to others. Communication is key when it comes to working with others and the most important part of communication is not when you are talking but when you are listening. Listening not only allows you to understand where people are coming from but also allows you to think about things in a different way. From this I have learned to be a better listener which in turn has made me a better communicator.",I should be selected for this program because I am very interested in exploring and learning more about engineering. Engineering has always been an interest of mine but I have not been able to narrow down what specifically I want to do. I feel that by participating in this program I will be able to have a better understanding of what I want to be. I also want to be selected for this program because I would love to have the opportunity to be a part of a program that offers so much. Not only will I get the chance to have hands on experience I will be able to learn about the college application process and life after college. Overall this program is like no other and I would love to be able to experience it. Along with the many things I can take away from this program I believe that I will be able to bring things also. I am a unique and creative thinker with much to offer.

I would daily go to the assigned class that I chose in the morning, and would learn upon that particular topic. For instance, I chose flood engineering, and I learned about how to exactly produce a mechanism that would read when a flood was about to start. Towards the afternoon the entire group would play fun games and activities. Overall, I grasped a general feel for the campus at UVA, and made new friends.","In general I just really love helping people and their troubling needs, like an actual engineer. By either fixing their problems or by originating new works I can help advance the world’s technological field and those who are living in it. Hence that is the sole reason why I want to become an engineer. Women have been slightly dis acknowledged for advancing in the engineering field, but I want to be one of the very few who pursues to do so.
As a child, my parents have always seemed to notice that I enjoyed asking several questions about how the world around me functioned. Playdough and Lego always intrigued me to produce imaginations that flowed through my mind. Sometimes I would create the most extravagant masterpieces such as a spacecraft or even the simplest creations of a flower. Instead of like my other friends who would play with dolls, I mysteriously seemed to be more fascinated with items that I could build off of. Later on, my parents discovered that I was peculiarly entrenched with airplanes, rockets, and mostly anything that flew in the high endless sky. I remember in second grade being asked by the teacher if I were to have any superpower what would it be, and I said flying. From then on I knew that my dream career was to be an aerospace engineer. I am interested in the creative and mechanical aspect of producing a real life object that can fly in the air.  I became extremely excited when I watched the space film, “The Martian. “The complex yet simple spacecraft designed by NASA to save Mark Watney out of Mars was unbelievable.  It was the best comedy, science, and action movie that I have ever watched. It was truly phenomenal. Hopefully, in the mere run I will accomplish my high ranking goal of majoring and then becoming an aerospace engineer. 
","I was offered a day program at Lockheed Martin with a few of my school classmates. At the program, I was grouped with a total of eight randomly arranged girls. As a team assignment, we needed to creatively design a course to make a golf ball fall into the bucket with the given a genre of materials. At first, our group was stumped of ideas until we started brainstorming as a group. With the string, paper clip, and marble our group first made a “pulley” to kick the golf ball down the plastic cup tunnel, so that the ball would have enough momentum to fall into the bucket on its own. We dismantled the paper clip to form an “n” shape and attached the string unto the middle of the “n” shape. Then we tied the marble unto the string. The pulley would be attached at the top of a cardboard wall. In addition, the front end of the plastic cup tunnel was taped to the cardboard, and the bottom end was taped unto the table. The problem was that the tunnel was too short; forcing the ball to randomly move on its own before reaching the bucket. As a result my group collectively built a wall of Popsicle sticks and plastic straws to guide where the golf ball would go. Then with the remaining cup, our group decided to build a concoction where we would wrap rubber bands around the cup as a sort of trampoline towards the end of the course. Instead of the ball traveling in a straight line after coming down the tunnel, the ball would now travel straight, bounce off the trampoline, and then go straight into the basket. As a result, the plan was a success. Whenever there was a bump in the plot, the team would come together and discuss upon how to fix it. By putting all our ideas together, the plan evolved into a masterpiece, becoming a huge crowd pleaser to the other groups in the end. I gained a lot of new insight from the other students, while also putting forth my own ideas as if an exchange.  It was astonishing that I met many new friends, and that I am still in contact with them today. ","I should be selected in this program because I am a diligent worker who focuses on the overall goal/accomplishment. Academically, I enjoy overwhelmingly challenging problems and am determined in solving it, similar to an engineer. Since I have been offered many different programs I have an advantage on a brief overview of the basics in engineering. In addition, I also love working in teams and socializing while getting to meet new friends from several different schools. I am an extrovert, so I am not afraid to get out of my comfort zone to greet new associates that I may have not ever seen before. However, it would be nice to know how to develop new everlasting friendships especially in a college ground setting. Also, since the program is just for women I hope that I can make a sisterly bond with students who pursue the same goal of becoming a major female engineer. The C Tech^2 program will help me develop further advanced skills for my future as an engineer as I have the opportunity to meet actual engineers who work in the field. I overall, wish that I can beforehand further in depth the vast world of engineering by partaking in the C-Tech^2 program.","By checking this box, I am electronically signing this online application and acknowledging that the information I have provided is accurate to the best of my knowledge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I want to create something great that will benefit society and the welfare of others. Whether it be a water filtration system or a bridge connecting cities, I would like to be able to help improve upon the human condition. I would like to combine environmental science and engineering in order to improve the kinship of society and nature by creating systems that will benefit both. With the many problems arising from pollution like toxins in the air or runoff from factories, I want to come up with solutions to decrease the amount of pollution in the environment and make areas safer. James A. Michener once said “Scientists dream about doing great things, engineers do them.” I Why not be both a Scientist and an engineer? If I can make one person’s life better with something I have created, I see that as one step closer to global happiness. This new age of millennials brings a new force of passion and persistence, and those two traits added on to the knowledge I gain in this profession, will allow me to change the world and make it a better place for everyone; one feat at a time.","Being an INJT personality type, I am known for stepping up when it is needed. Recently in my AP World class, I was assigned a group project.  The assignment was to rank the importance of engineering feats of the Industrial Revolution such as the steam engine and internal combustion engine. The difficulty in this project was that it was very open ended in terms of what criteria we were to use to rank these inventions.  As a result, there were several heated discussions surrounding what issues members felt were more important than others. Our teacher gave us a deadline of one week. With this deadline presented, I organized the other members of our group by deciding to incorporate their discussions in the presentation.  We all decided to use a Prezi to display our information, and each group member was going to do two slides. After we stopped working on it in class, our group continued keep in contact to make sure everyone knew of each other’s progress and their rationale for each rank. Then, we met to bring together all our work into one fluid presentation a few days before the presentation date. We also discussed who was going to present during the presentation. Before we presented, it was evident that we were all confident in the work each other produced.  Being able to work a solution out for my peers who felt very strongly about their own opinion made me feel proud because I was able to convince them of this better idea. ","If I was selected for the program, I would offer my diligence and drive to learn. I seek out opportunities to find out all I can about what I am interested in.  I am very passionate about global environmental issues and am concerned about the health of our planet. Therefore, this program will help me explore the capabilities of what engineers can achieve. Also, being only a sophomore in high school, I am still a little unsure about what exact field of study I want to go into. With this program, I can gain interests outside of environmental engineering and into industrial or civil engineering. These experiences will broaden my mind what all the different specific fields that this profession can offer. Also, this camp will allow me to improve my interpersonal and collaborative skills. In the future, I most likely won’t be working alone in what I am trying to accomplish. This camp will allow me to learn how to work with others and hopefully establish new connections. Lastly, I love science, and finding new solutions for problems. This program will be a fun experience that will help me express my love for science, while learning new things along the way.","By checking this box, I am electronically signing this online application and acknowledging that the information I have provided is accurate to the best of my knowledge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I want to show them that no matter what your gender is you can be successful in any engineering field. An engineer is someone who manipulates objects, like machines, numbers, wood, steel, and many other things to do their bidding. Engineers created the wheel. Engineers produced the stilettos. Engineers developed treatments for cancer. Engineers sent us into space. With hard work and determination, engineers will put humans on mars, advance our medical treatments, and develop new technologies. I want to be a part of all those things. That’s why I want to be an engineer.","When I went to Space Camp last summer, our group went to a team activity place called Area 51. There, we had to work as a team to solve every problem. One challenge in particular was the most difficult. There were stumps in ground and we had to form a bridge out of planks to get across. The catch was that we were only allowed two planks and if anyone fell off of the planks, they had to be blind-folded. Communication was key and so was guiding the people who were blinded, either by speaking to them or holding onto them and pulling them forward. It was very difficult because in the end almost everyone was blind-folded, myself included. Eventually, after many laughs and obstacles, we all made it across. Afterwards, the councilors in charge of the event said that we were the best team since we all helped each other, were kind to one another, and kept a positive attitude. I will always remember that event since it was one of the first times I've ever enjoyed and felt welcome on a team.","I believe that I should be selected for this program because I want to help make a difference in the world and I think this program would help me achieve that goal.

",,,"How, What, and Why 
In 1858 Ezra Warner invented a can opener in which one had to penetrate the surface before hand sawing around the edges in order to remove the lid. Today, however, that same job can be done by the simple push of a button. Ideas have evolved to form new tools and machines and I want to be a part of the evolution. To me, why gadgets work and how they were designed to work in such a way is extremely captivating. Examining how and why things work is what I love, and engineering completes the puzzle with the discovery of what to do in order to enhance the how and the why. 
I have always been curious about how and why appliances work the way they do, but I had never considered it as a career until one night a few years ago when I watched the show Better Off Ted (the synopsis being a crew of scientists creating absurd inventions) with my dad. That night I went to bed with visions of engineering dancing in my head, fantasizing that one day I too may become part of a crew, applying practical application of my knowledge, and putting my love for math and physics to work. Of course I do not aspire to weaponize a pumpkin or produce bouncy, edible metal, as they did in the show, but the thought of taking an idea and making it tangible is truly amazing! Not just that, but I am also fascinated by the idea of transforming existing products to make them safer and more efficient. I want to invest my life in a career I am passionate about and engineering perfectly fits the hopes and dreams of the curious child who was always wondering how, what, and why.
","Discovering the Importance of Teamwork

Helen Keller once said, “Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much.” This holds true for every sport, including softball, which is and has always been, a major part of my life. Growing up in a world of athletics, the essentials of teamwork have always been drilled into my head, but I did not fully understand its importance until the summer of 2012, when my softball team was in Lebanon, Virginia, playing for the state championship. In one of the qualifying rounds, our team was losing badly. Everybody was playing as individuals, and not as a team. A batter would try to hit a home run instead of putting the ball in play. The shortstop would try to tag a runner instead of making the easier out, and the slowest runner would try to steal a base without being told to do so by the coach. The experience was unprecedented. It was our first time in a major competition, and we were all focused on impressing our “fans,” rather than collaborating. Fortunately, during the third inning, lightning lit up the sky and we had to go to our respective dugouts to wait out the storm. At first we just sat there, moping about the inevitable loss as our coach lectured us. All of a the sudden someone began rhythmically tapping a ball on the bench, then another person started brushing their cleat on the ground, and another started beat boxing. Before I knew it, we were all singing Journey’s, Don’t Stop Believing, laughing, and bonding as a team. We remembered how to have fun, to support and to trust each other, and to work together. After the rain delay we took the field again, but this time as a team. One batter sacrificed herself to advance another. An outfielder gave up her chance to be a star and threw the ball to me instead of trying to throw it all the way home. We came back from a nine run deficit to win the game. We began the game “alone, doing so little,” but finished “together,” and were able to “do so much.”
","Why Me
With lockers for protection, I crouched in the corner, clutching my video camera in anticipation as my teammate activated our robot. Our first attempt had not gone quite as planned. Our robot had gone rogue due to a miscalculation on weight distribution. We were using Engineering techniques in order to design, build, and improve our robot’s structure. In this case, we had to lower the center of gravity in order to ensure a sturdier design. Attending camp and experiencing different fields of engineering will help me determine the aspect of engineering in which I choose to study.
If selected I will offer my existing skills. At the camp I can work with others and contribute to the group with my creative mindset, math and physics skills, and unwillingness to give up. No matter the task I am given, I will give my greatest effort and attack all challenges at every angle until my group and I have come up with a definitive solution. I will embrace my opportunity, if given the chance, and actively participate so I can get the most out of the camp and further my knowledge, preparing myself for the years to come. I will also use what I learn at the camp to live up to the Tech motto, Ut Prosim, so that I may serve.

GiantBug's Ivy League Innovation Program, Harvard and MIT - Focused on STEM entrepreneurial skills","When people would ask me about my favorite subject, even as a child, my response would be math. It’s not an easy subject, but the challenge makes the solution so much more rewarding. There is just something about the way that equations ebb and flow that provides pure satisfaction. While my friends grudgingly anticipate our math assignments, I look forward to doing them first. 
To further explore my interest in STEM, I chose to take an Engineering and Design course my sophomore year. It was one of the best decisions I made that year. Within the first month of that class, I knew engineering was right for me. Our first project was to create puzzles for children with Down syndrome in our community. Our team worked meticulously to design the puzzle. When we got to building, we hit a wall. Some of our pieces were could not be created with the tools we had, so we had to reassess the design. This project taught me that engineering is a process of improvement and change. 
After we finished the project, we had the opportunity to see the children play with the puzzle. The smiles on their faces were impeccable. In that moment, I realized that engineering is not only about math and science, but helping people. The pure satisfaction of putting a smile on those children’s faces made our group effort project meaningful.
The project taught me that engineering is about improving people’s lives. Engineering is all around us. From the cars we drive to the toys we played with as kids, engineering is all around us. When I look at the various objects around me, I often find myself wondering why they are most effective in their current designs. Then I come up with possible reasons, and how they could be improved. I am very passionate when it comes to enhancing the quality of life of myself and those around me. As an engineer, I would aspire to improve the condition of the world around me. 
","I love learning new things, especially when it comes to math and science. Whenever we learn new material in class, I am the student asking a multitude of questions about the inner-workings of the concept. 
Engineering is about applying concepts to the real-world. I hope to have a career in engineering. At C-Tech², I hope to understand and explore my options and the various branches of engineering. This program will help me get a clearer picture of where I would like to be in that spectrum. I am very intrigued by the variety of engineering branches covered by the program and feel it will help me choose my engineering major. 
C-Tech² will also give me an opportunity to work with other likeminded students. I am also excited by the fact that we will get to work as a team on various hands on projects. I am a great team player and would be a good participant for the course. At C-Tech², I will be able to get a sneak peak of what it would be like, working as an engineer solving real-world problems. I am also considering going to Virginia Tech once I graduate high school. C-Tech² will help me better understand life in Blacksburg as a college student. 
I can definitely add value to the course by being an active participant and asking lots of interesting questions. I will also maintain a positive attitude and open mind throughout the program to gain the most life-changing experience possible. 
","For my sophomore year, I had decided to take an Engineering and Design class to further explore my interest in STEM. Our first project was to create puzzles for children with Down syndrome in our community.  
We all brainstormed some possible designs and conducted further research to zero in on the specifics. I was interested in determining the shapes and designs that best engaged the children. Another teammate was interested in the textures and a third looked into the production necessities of the puzzle. We would all check up on each other and ask questions for clarification to ensure we would not make any mistake or disregard some important aspect of the puzzle.  
When we finalized on our product, it was time to create! However, partway through the project, we realized we could not create some of our design as the tools provided were not precise enough. So, we were back to the drawing board. It took us a while, but we finally came up with a more practical design. Taking turns, we double and triple checked the design to ensure its practicality. 
For our puzzle, we adapted the concept of a rubix cube. Our puzzle was a cube, put together by randomly shapes pieces. Each side of the cube was painted one color. The goal of the puzzle was to put the pieces together so each face of the cube was one color. 
At the end of the project, our hard work paid off. The kids loved the toys! My favorite aspect of the project was the designing. First, we would all share our thoughts on a solution and get feedback. Then, we would try to incorporate the positives of each of our ideas to create a well balanced design that addresses every aspect of the toy. 
I love working in teams as it allows everyone to contribute to their thoughts. With more ideas and solutions out in the open, the team has a greater chance of finding the best solution. A person alone cannot do as good a job. Our designs would not be nearly as good as they turned out, if we had worked on it alone.

Perry Initiative- A day long Biomedical Engineering and Orthopedic Surgery Program (held at VCU) that worked with High School girls to discover what it takes to be an Orthopedic Surgeon.","Ever since I was given a Lego set in fourth grade, I've wanted to be an architect. As I've grown, I’ve been exposed to different disciplines within architecture. And while I love designing buildings, I also love the ocean -- whether sailing, swimming, or enjoying a day at the beach. I would like to major in Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering so I can design ships and other floating structures for the U.S. Navy. The major combines the beauty of art and design with the challenge of making an object move, float, and in some cases operate as a small city. Functionality, design, technology, and mathematics all play a large role in Naval Architecture and in life. I've been fortunate enough to learn about engineering through many different experiences. I've worked with the Society of Women in Engineering to design and build a device to improve fine motor skills for a special needs elementary class. With the Perry Initiative, I learned how biomedical engineering and orthopedic surgery intersect to make medicine better, and with General Atomics, to learn about aerospace engineering and see how female engineers are changing the workplace. Engineering isn't just one job. It is a well-rounded profession that includes various aspects of many professions, which is exciting to me. (I don’t want to work at a desk all day.) With each engineering discovery and innovation, peoples lives are changed. I want to be a part of a profession that changes the world. ","Freshman year I had the opportunity to participate in a Society of Women in Engineering program for high schoolers. Our group was tasked with creating a toy for a special needs classroom that would help develop fine motor skills. We visited the classroom and met with the teachers and aides to gain their perspective about how the toy would be utilized and what conditions it would have to work in. We assessed our own capabilities, budget, and childhood experiences and decided on a wooden-peg maze with LED lights. A child could drag a peg through a maze and be rewarded with lights as they reached certain checkpoints. In my group, there were two other girls and our mentor, an electrical engineer. As our deadline approached, we started working on the electrical side of the project because we had finished the woodworking. Since we had to do all of the wiring ourselves with minimal guidance from our mentor, it was quite challenging. We ran into problems with the conductors that turned on the lights because they were too sturdy for the peg to pass through easily. Other times, the circuit wasn't complete because the conductors were too close or the battery pack would disconnect. After several attempts adjusting the conductors in the toy, we realized the way to solve the problem was to create a peg with a thinner circumference that would graze the conductor. We used a smaller screw, a bolt, and a washer to solve the problem. When we were done, the peg could easily slide through the grooves while still turning on the lights that corresponded with each picture on the toy. We completed the circuit by making the customer happy and by fulfilling our goal of a working product. ","Growing up around the world has shaped my worldview and ideas in ways that no one else can match. I’ve been blessed with the opportunity to live in Guam (twice!), Washington, DC, San Diego, and now Chesapeake, VA, thanks to my Dad’s Navy career. The geography, culture, and unique opportunities of each place at different stage of my life have taught me to adapt, be flexible, and overcome. When we are fixated on one way of doing something, we can overlook ideas that a fresh perspective might introduce. The experiences I've had and the places I've been are quite unique and I can offer a perspective that’s different from the students who have lived in one place their whole life. I’m just a year away from graduating high school, and my dream is to become a naval engineer and serve as an officer in the United States Navy after college. Our dreams are unique to each and every one of us. In my current high school, none of my friends share my unique interest and military aspirations. I am hopeful that when surrounded by like-minded young women, I can find others that reflect my curiosity, my willingness to pursue a rigorous academic program, and to strive for a cause greater than my own.

I discovered my ambition funnily enough, from reading the Percy Jackson series. One of the main characters, Annabeth, was always talking about her aspiration to become an architect or an engineer, and I realized I wanted to do that as well. I realized that engineering was the perfect fit for me. It could serve as a culmination of all of the qualities I have, that I revere: leadership, problem-solving, mathematic talent, and artistic ability (among other things). I want to be an engineer, because I love that it requires problem-solving. I love working to find alternate and better methods to solve challenges that are thrown my way. I think it’s so fascinating how engineers can think of solutions to problems that no one would think of otherwise. This is exactly what I aspire to do in life as an engineer. Collaborate with my co-workers to solve a problem, and then utilize my math and art skills to create a beautiful, functional, world-bettering masterpiece.","I have worked in teams often to solve problems. One recent note-worthy one was when I was in a STEM club meeting. We were trying to figure out projects that we wanted to work on to present at the competition, and we were trying to come up with new ideas after realizing our first idea was not achievable with our time limit and budget. To solve the problem, I worked with some of my friends to research topics, and when we found a new one, a couple of girls and I all stood up at the whiteboard to come up with design ideas. After looking at each other’s ideas, we all collaborated to make one design that was a combination of all of our ideas. We each tweaked the design a little bit, until we came up with a final, rough draft design that we were all really proud of. If it wasn’t for that collaboration, we would not have come up with our new topic, and we definitely wouldn’t have come up with the design.","I should be selected for this program, because we (the program and I) can provide a lot for each other. I would contribute strong leadership, clever problem-solving abilities, mathematical proficiency, and artistic ability. I think I would prove a strong member in my team, and contribute to an amazing final project. The program would also be of great benefit to me. It would teach me to collaborate on ideas with others, responsibility, independence, and it would help me prepare for my journey in college applications. I should be selected for this program, because I think I would be a perfect candidate, and the program, my fellow students, and I, would all benefit greatly.","By checking this box, I am electronically signing this online application and acknowledging that the information I have provided is accurate to the best of my knowledge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

","I want to be an engineer because I enjoy learning, solving problems, and working with others. To me, the creative learning process begins with hands- on discovery. As early as age 2, I learned by having fun, building Lego structures and towers from wooden blocks. I have carried this approach to the present to help me to better understand concepts and ideas. I think that becoming an engineer would allow me to continue to learn by having fun while solving real-world problems.

There will always be challenges, from correcting a faulty design to providing clean water to the world. Although most people would view these issues as barriers, I see these problems as puzzles that can be solved. Analyzing the details of a problem while maintaining perspective on the big picture can be similar to how you might solve a Sudoku puzzle, one of my favorite pastimes. By looking for what is and what is not possible given the available information, you can develop alternative possible solutions that lead to the right answer.

Sometimes the best way to solve a problem is by getting the perspectives of other people. Although a group might share similar interests, they often think in different ways. Collaborating with others to develop ideas and solutions leads to learning from each other and the improvement of all team members. In addition, the diversity of ideas created by working with a group of other people will create a more well-rounded solution. In short, I want to be an engineer that enjoys solving problems with others.
","Working with a group to solve problems is important because ideas are more comprehensive, teams can achieve more than individuals, and team differences can lead to better solutions. Although it is often said that great minds think alike, the diversity found within a team leads to new viewpoints and a more complete solution. For example, I was member of a three-person team that developed a Rube Goldberg machine for a science project. The three of us brainstormed and came up with a seven-step machine that converted the energy of a rolling ball to turn a magazine page. The team approach allowed us to brainstorm, develop the seven stages, and combine them into a working machine.

Teamwork often creates something that individuals cannot do alone. On swim team, relying on others and helping teammates is crucial to the overall success of the team. Even though some events are individual, the support of teammates and hard work accomplished together leads to a tight knit group that can rely on each other for support and encouragement. Marching band displays a different type of teamwork. Each musician has a specific route and speed of movement to follow in order to form a picture on a grand scale. Music playing, style, and marching must all be synchronized for the band to create a show that thousands of spectators can enjoy.

By collaborating with a team to solve a problem, the solution can be more thorough and the work divided by specialty. Sometimes, teamwork poses challenges such as personality differences and inefficient time management. For instance, when designing the Rube Goldberg machine with my friends it took time for us to come up with a solution that incorporated everybody’s input. After a while, we started to work as a team to overcome the initial time delays to develop a better Rube Goldberg machine than I could have done alone.
","I should be selected for the C-Tech2 program because I will greatly benefit from the college information and hands-on learning provided while contributing back to the other participants in the program. I think that the C-Tech2 program will help me prepare for college by exposing me to a variety of engineering fields and giving me perspectives that are not available through my school classes or extracurricular activities. Although I am interested in studying engineering in college, I am not sure which discipline that I want to pursue. This camp will lead me closer to choosing a field of study. Furthermore, I will learn more about the college application process and information on university selection. Through the C-Tech2 program I will become more informed on additional programs and opportunities that will help me when applying to college.

Participating in hands-on activities at the C-Tech2 program will help me to better understand which engineering discipline I will enjoy. I think the C-Tech2 program is unique in that it provides the attendees with the opportunity to learn about multiple engineering disciplines in an applied setting. I have always been a visual and hands-on learner, so I have enjoyed projects such as building DNA models and constructing a three-dimensional plant cell using items found around the house. Because of my interest in learning more about college opportunities and my enjoyment of learning, I will benefit if I am selected to participate in the C- Tech2 program. In conclusion, I believe the C-Tech2 program will benefit by selecting me because I am enthusiastic about joining the program, I enjoy working with others, and I am a well-rounded student who participates in athletics and the arts.

The engineer’s role in society is to create new technologies that help transform the way we live. An engineer must be creative, engaged, and have a strong understanding and appreciation for the fields of math and science. I decided I would like to pursue a career in which I can make a difference in the world to help sculpt the future. I thoroughly enjoy and excel in math and science and pride myself on working hard to figure out problems and uncertainties in these areas through my school work. I’m also constantly interested and amazed by the way things work whether it is on the molecular level, electronically, or physiologically.
 I would like to work in an occupation in which I get to think outside the box to solve a problem, fix the situation, or produce a new product through a design or critical thinking. Working in a field in which I can observe that I having an impact on the way people live as well as interacting with others.
Another reason why I would like to pursue engineering is that for as long as I can remember I’ve always been captivated by learning why or how certain things work the way they do. I would often find myself wondering how a phone is able to respond so quickly to the touch of a finger or why a person’s biology causes them to react in a particular way. I also found that when I became faced with that question, I enjoyed applying my knowledge to explain or support a specific topic or situation. These factors are key components to the critical thinking that engineers must do on a day-to-day basis.
Therefore, I would like to become an engineer because I have always been interested in the way that things work and love to learn about math and science. I also believe it is an innovative and impactful career path that constantly changes the way that people live.","Recently, I had the opportunity to work as part of a team at my school’s model UN conference. Over 100 students were delegates and worked with peers regarding various topics in order to come to international agreements.
Before the conference, participants had to research their designated country and a specific issue that currently impacts the country as well as general information. The country I analyzed was Indonesia regarding, the refugee crisis, that is prevalent in their country. It was important to not only research this topic but also the country’s geography, foreign relations, values, and exports. Knowing these things created a more well-rounded view of the country that was necessary to represent them. This research was an integral part of being able to solve the designated problem. The preparation made it easier to collaborate with other members responsible for different issues in the country as well as negotiating with other countries.
When collaborating with Indonesia’s delegates, it was important to know the information and prioritize the issues. By working as a team, we identified what was most pressing and found our country’s strength. This made it easier to work with members from other countries because we knew exactly what we needed and what we could offer to provide a more beneficial interaction.
It was important to be open to ideas and take into consideration other country’s stances to arrive at the best resolution. If delegates from the countries were not forthcoming with suggestions, the resolution would be weak and unrealistic, causing it not to pass. Knowing the other countries’ points of view was important to formulate a better offer and relationships to solve the problem without further strain on involved countries.
Having this experience, I was able to come to the realization that the best problem-solving is a result of preparation, communication, and willingness to help others and come to relevant solution even if you have contrasting opinio","By attending C2-Tech at Virginia Tech, my goal would be to gain the most knowledge possible and use it in my life whether it be finding a career or on an everyday basis. I make extreme efforts to be respectful and considerate towards others which enables me to better work with others when solving problems. Having a good work ethic and being motivated are two things that I pride myself on and are shown in all my endeavors. Analytical thinking is also something that I find very interesting and can be very beneficial in the activities I will encounter in this program. 
I should be considered for this camp because I would love the opportunity to be able to experience how engineers creatively think to solve a problem and produce a realistic outcome and how it differs in various specialties. By getting this hands-on experience, the program would provide me with an irreplaceable and extraordinarily valuable experience in different technologically based fields.
I’m also an extremely motivated and conscientious worker and will work hard to have the most beneficial experience. I would also enjoy the experience to be able to work with others and find innovative ways that would replicate experiences that we may encounter as future engineers. Having respect for others, motivation, and passion for learning are characteristics that I would bring to the table as part of a problem-solving team. Above all else, it is important to me to have an enjoyable and enlightening experience surrounded by others in which I can relate to and have fun as we all face the same question of how we want engineering to impact our lives and the lives of others.
In conclusion, I should be selected for this program because I am very devoted to whatever I apply myself to and want to broaden my horizons. I would use this experience to learn to solve problems as a team more effectively in both my future occupation and in my everyday life.","By checking this box, I am electronically signing this online application and acknowledging that the information I have provided is accurate to the best of my knowledge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I would play with legos with my brother and, while he built tall towers, I built intricate houses and cars. Now, when I walk around cities, I notice cranes and amazing architecture. I always try to figure out how things were built and how they move like they do. To be thinking about that stuff for a job, and to be on the other side building those things for a job would be so cool. My dad is an engineer, and I grew up watching him work. He would take me to job sites with him, and I have been to the geotechnical conference that he organizes. I want to work in an atmosphere like my dad does and do the things he does. I like to solve problems, and like a good challenge. I enjoy learning new things from new people. I always see things and think, ‘how does that work?’ Building things and solving problems in the real world is something I believe that I would really enjoy. ","When I participate in Envirothon, I work in a team. Envirothon is a school club where you learn about and study the environment around you. You compete against other schools in teams of six. On competition day, you take a group test in five topics: wildlife, aquatics, forestry, soils, and current events. Each person on the team has a different topic that they focus on. I have been competing for six years. I mainly study wildlife, but have learned things from all topics. Over the years my team and I have had to solve many problems together. We have always placed pretty good and had fun doing it. Last year, we only had half a team because everyone else was sick. The rest of us had to work together to complete everything. We had to use context clues and common sense to figure out the answers, and we came in fifth place. This experience has helped me to learn to trust myself and the abilities of others. It has also helped me figure out that I love solving problems, especially in the world around me. Being in Envirothon has given me the ability to learn things about the environment and have fun doing it. 
","I would love to be able to learn more about engineering and the many different types there are. All the types are different, and I want to learn about them all. Environmental and civil engineering interest me the most. Protecting and learning about the environment is important to me. I want to see if engineering is what I want to do with my life. I want to experience all different kinds and find out which one is my favorite. I am eager to learn and try new things. I work well in group settings, and I enjoy meeting new people. Having this opportunity to learn more about engineering would be a great opportunity for me. It would allow me to step outside my comfort zone. I am very excited about this experience, and I am grateful that you have taken the time to consider me.","By checking this box, I am electronically signing this online application and acknowledging that the information I have provided is accurate to the best of my knowledge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When I was a little kid, I would spend hours playing with LEGOs and doing puzzles.When I was in elementary and middle school I was involved in a lot of different activities in the STEM or creative thinking field. I did chess club, math club, Lego Robotics, computer rebuilding club, Odyssey of the Mind, and Girls Engineering Club. I always loved doing these activities, but the summer going into high school I joined the cross country team after hearing that it was a great way to meet new people. I enjoyed it so much I continued on to participate in winter and spring track. I love running and the team is great, but it has been a year and a half since I have been regularly involved in solving a problem by building a machine or using math in a real world example, and I really miss it. I am taking engineering next year at my school, but I have also started researching engineering careers. I am drawn the fact that it is a very hands on career and my work could actually benefit others.","When I was in elementary and middle school, I participated in Odyssey of the Mind, or OM. OM is an extracurricular activity where you have a team made up of seven kids, and you get to chose one of five problems to solve. Your solution should be creative and it has to meet certain criteria that is specific to each problem. Another part of the program is that all the ideas and props have to be made by the kids, no parents can help. Through this experience I learned so much about working on a team. We had to work together throughout the whole process, deciding which problem we wanted to do, coming up with our solution to the problem, making props, writing the script, and overcoming challenges. I remember one year we did a problem called Weird Science where you had to look at an image from a NASA picture and come up with an alternative to what it truly was. We decided to make it an abominable snowman. For part of our solution we had to make it look like the snowman was melting and his nose and eyes were falling off. When we were practicing before our real performance our machine kept malfunctioning. We had to work together to find a solution quickly. That year our team was able to place 3rd at the world competition. I believe it was because of our teamwork, creativity, and quick problem solving skills. The other part of the OM competition is called spontaneous, where we had to solve a problem given to us on the spot within seven minutes. In certain types of problems we could not talk while finding our solution. Other times we had to create an invention out of random materials, like paper clips, cotton balls, and sheets of paper, and present it to the judges. During these problems we were judged on how we worked together as a team and how creative and effective our solution was. If people on the team were fighting over what we should do, we got docked points. This helped me learn how to be an effective team member.","Aside from the fact that I love math, problem solving, and building things, I am very good at working on a team and working with people I do not know. My freshman year I joined the leadership class at our school. I was the only freshman in the class and had to quickly become friends and work with people who had known each other for much longer. Through this class I learned about how to communicate and cooperate with others. We had to plan homecoming, spirit weeks, pep rallies, and wellness weeks. Although homecoming is not exactly engineering, it presented problems to my group and helped me learn how to work with others to solve them. Also I have a real interest in the field of engineering and I would bring my enthusiasm to my work at C-Tech2 this summer.

During this program, we were studying introductory neuroscience topics through lectures and lab work including dissection of a sheep brain and assay testing. We were able to learn how to use assays, while testing the cortisol levels among students, comparing, and analyzing the data. ","This day in age is another day for technological advancement and innovation. We wouldn’t be where we are today without the development of new ideas and the people that made them happen. For my whole childhood, I have yearned for a magical fairy godmother to grant my wishes, just like any other child has. To just say some words and have anything appear at your whim is anyone’s dream. However, ideas stay only ideas until one takes the initiative to make them into reality. Over the years, I have learned that if one wants to make a change, then he or she has to be that change, whether it be in politics or in the scientific world. Looking around, I am still in awe that every tool we use today had to have been thought of and carried out by a person, who did not settle to watch the world stagnant, but wanted progress. A simple toaster that one puts his bread in required a person to design everything from the inside out. All the parts and the mechanisms had to be constructed to perform what we may see as a simple task. That simple tool has been globalized and has become a common device that everyone uses. I strive to make a change that has such a lasting impact and betters the lifestyle of future generations. Today’s engineering has become immensely more complex, some even on the molecular scale; for example, in biomedical engineering, a new brain imaging system using magnetoencephalography is being developed to measure blood pressure, or in chemical engineering, chemiluminescent molecules are used for monitoring cells. The possibilities are endless. The fact that an engineer makes a dream into reality for millions of the future is the reason why I want to become an engineer. I may not be able to have a fairy grandmother or become one, but an engineer is a close second. ","Currently, I am partaking in an international research collaboration with a peer at the Loudoun Academy of Science and two students from Daegu Science High School in South Korea. We are trying to find the effect of various temperatures on the amount of methanol produced from the hydrogenation of carbon dioxide in the novel solvent polyethylene glycol. This solvent is safer than what has been previously used, and if successful, we would have been able to synthesize a highly efficient and less corrosive fuel as well as advance a method of recycling carbon dioxide. However, it has been months since we have implemented our project, and we have come across many obstacles. We do not have a reactor while the South Koreans do; as a result, we had to develop our own. Thus far, we have been working on the engineering and learning what parts are needed and their roles rather than the chemistry. Through some orders of the wrong parts and unavailability of needed materials, we have been able to work around it by buying the new parts and contacting different manufacturers for alternatives, accommodating for the inconveniences. Admittedly, my partners and I have had disagreements and difficulty in communication. Getting ideas across the ocean and settling on resolutions with our South Korean partners has been challenging. I have even come across disputes with my AOS partner. Each time our ideas diverge, I learned to listen to all thoughts before making a decision. I have been able to learn how to compromise, a hard task. Human nature tends to lead people to stay biased; although I am still learning, I have made considerable progress in learning the true spirit of collaboration and how to deal with colliding thoughts. This has opened my eyes and made me realize that others have a perspective that I will never be able to see from; instead of getting defensive, I have learned to reevaluate the whole situation before acting, which has helped us overcome such impediments.","Engineering is a great passion I plan to pursue. Even though I have had some experiences with chemical engineering in my research, I have much more to learn. The long journey awaits, and this opportunity will help me decide what type of engineering I want to delve into. In addition to chemical engineering, biomedical engineering is a particular field that I am interested in. I have only been able to learn the fundamentals of chemical engineering and need more exposure to the different fields engineering has to offer; some basic skills that I possess include performing an assay, using a spectrophotometer, and using a GC. These abilities are not as engineering-oriented as I would like them to be, which is why this program would be such a great fit. Not only will I be able to learn more about myself and what I like, but I will also be under different mentors that I have not been accustomed to. Every instructor is different in the way he or she teaches, and I have been able to learn so much from those who have taught me in the past. With this program, I will be in a new environment and experience different teaching methods, expanding my versatility. Through this opportunity, I will be able to see how life will be like in a little over a year. Virginia Tech is one of my prospective schools, and being in this program will enable me to explore the campus and almost experience how it feels like to be a Hokie. Through attending the Academy of Science, I have grown to be persistent and my avid love for science has exponentially increased; my enthusiasm, experience, love for engineering, and desire to learn more makes me a great addition to the C-Tech^2 community and experience.","By checking this box, I am electronically signing this online application and acknowledging that the information I have provided is accurate to the best of my knowledge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

O2: Outdoor Opportunities, 2017-present",None.,"I want to be an engineer because I have always loved math and science. Each day I look forward to my math and science classes.  One of my favorite lessons, in chemistry class, was when we got an assignment to work in pairs to create an extract. Our task was to choose any type of extract, and then make it.  We had to figure out how to achieve this goal on our own as our teacher didn’t offer any instructions or guidelines. My partner and I began throwing out names of different objects that could be extracted and after naming twenty or so items, we decided to work on lavender because both our mom’s like lavender-scented items and we thought that we could give our product to them as gifts.  We were very optimistic.

We had fun experimenting in different ways.  We first tried to get this extract by putting the lavender flowers into water, boiling it to bring out the lavender scent, then letting it cool in order for the water to evaporate, leaving behind the lavender scent. Unfortunately, this didn’t work because when we left the water to evaporate overnight, the lavender scent along with the water evaporated.  My partner and I then tried using ethanol in place of water, being very careful to control the rate of evaporation.  In the end, it wasn’t the purest of lavender extracts because some of the ethanol remained.  But we had a good time trying to make it. 

Therefore, in my experience, it is always interesting to try different things because even if it doesn’t turn out right the first time, it helps you figure out a better way for next time. This is why I want to be an engineer, so that I can experiment to achieve a goal and when I achieve that goal it has the potential to be something amazing.
","I play for a soccer team, the Highline Premier Football Club Eagles, and we had a soccer tournament in June, 2016. Since it was the beginning of the club season, it was our first tournament of the summer. Several members of the team were new and only had known each other for three weeks. Naturally, we hadn’t developed our communication skills as well as some of the other teams in the tournament. We didn’t understand how uncoordinated we were until after our first hard game. 

Returning to our hotel after just losing 3-0, our team co-captains brought us together to re-cap.  Our co-captains had identified our main problem being that we were not communicating with each other effectively. All of my team members were then asked to share how we could improve our communication out on the field.  Each player had their own preference of how they wanted to communicate during the game and we came up with some successful strategies on how we wanted to work with others on the field.  It was a great discussion and a good way to begin to know and understand my team.

We used these new methods for communicating to one another in the remaining games.  However, it was challenging for all of us to remember the best way to get our needs and wants known to our team members. Furthermore, in our second game, we used our new communication skills and tied 1-1. The opposing team that we played in this game was the best team in our division which made this tie feel more like a win than a tie to us. This also helped to validate how effective communication between team members on the field can also have a great impact on the score of the game.  An additional bonus was that each team member felt that they were now part of a team that had the potential to have a great season ahead.
","As I was completing this application and had to answer “none” to so many of the questions, I realized how deficient my inner-city public school education has been in many ways.  There simply aren’t any pre-engineering opportunities offered at my high school.  To have the chance to fly to the east coast and be with other high-school females exploring the various fields of engineering will be life-changing. This program will have a positive impact on me in many ways.

I have never taken a trip, not even for a day, without my family.  I have been on airplanes, but not without a parent.  Just getting to and from this engineering program will be a new, exciting experience for me.  

I believe that spending two weeks on a college campus will help to give me an idea of what to expect in college.  I have been visiting some colleges but only have had campus tours and classroom visits.  I feel that staying on your college campus, attending classes, making new friends, sharing dorm rooms, etc. for two weeks will help give me some needed confidence as I plan for college. Thinking about attending college is not only exciting, but terrifying as I try to imagine what it will be like.  I would like to take out some of this mystery.

Living in a dorm with others that are interested in engineering will be another unique experience for me if selected for this C-Tech2 Program.  This residential camp will give me and my classmates the chance to have hands-on experiences in many different fields of engineering. This will help me to narrow down my engineering choices when deciding on which engineering path that is right for me. Additionally, it will be enjoyable for me to listen and learn what the other students are thinking about engineering. Overall, this experience will be a big step for me, as I prepare for my future.

After completing an intensive 5-month online course, I was then selected to participate in this week long summer program. During this program, our team of students designed an original scientific mission to be launched and then performed within the International Space Station. At the end of the week, we presented our project to a group of NASA officials.","I’ve loved to solve problems throughout my entire life. When I was very young, my favorite problem-solving involved building with Legos. Although constructing the predesigned structures was pleasant, my favorite activity would be to build my own creations. While this only started out as designing a house or building, eventually my structures began to evolve into something more useful. For example, I noticed one day that leaving my toothbrush on the counter often ended up with it falling to the ground, so I built a toothbrush holder that could hold it firmly straight up. I went even further so as to attach other materials to it, such as plastic and twine, so that the water would drain into the sink whenever the toothbrush dripped. Fast-forward to my life today, and I still have that same passion and drive to solve problems. The only major difference between the past and now is that I am looking towards issues much bigger than toothbrushes. What I’m currently most interested in is devising a new form of cancer treatment and protecting astronauts from radiation during their journey to Mars. Not only do I find these particular dilemmas fascinating and intriguingly complex on their own, but I also have a strong determination to find a solution. I believe that this strong-willed attitude coupled with my tendency to come up with creative products and devices have coalesced into my desire to become an engineer. In fact, I can’t imagine being anything other than an engineer when I graduate college—nothing sounds more rewarding and enjoyable than being able to solve problems both small and large every day.","I have been participating in engineering classes throughout all three years of high school, and each project we work on always presents a new challenge. In the very beginning, we were all learning how to use 3D modeling software for the first time. During that introductory time period, it felt as if every action we made using the program required a significant amount of problem solving. The truth is, the real problem solving wouldn’t come until we began to draft and model our own products using the software. So far, the most difficult problem solving I’ve performed has been for the partner project we’re working on right now. The premise of this project is to create our very own candy dispenser that is designed both creatively and in a cost-effective manner. During the development of our first set of gears, my partner and I had to have an intensive brainstorming session. This was because our past projects have only ever involved a few modeled parts that were used mostly for visual reference, whereas this candy dispenser is an entire assembly full of 3D printed parts! While creating the gears was no problem, I had to heavily collaborate with my partner in order to guarantee our parts would all function together. Specifically, we had to ensure that we included the same tolerances and that each part could be used outside of a computer-generated assembly in conjunction with one another. Two whole classes went by before our individually created parts both fit together and allowed for smooth mechanical motion. Despite the difficulty this first aspect of the project has presented, it has been extremely enjoyable to problem solve together, and we’re both already excited to create the next set of gears!","College is the next rapidly approaching chapter of my life, and although I’m extremely excited for it, I also want to know more before it begins. I believe that this program will not only prepare me for this future experience, but it will also greatly aid in my ability to further explore my passion for engineering. Being able to attend this program would be the answer to all of my most pertinent questions revolving around my future in STEM, and it is because of this relevance that I would be sure to put in every ounce of effort into all the activities and projects. It’s not just the projects that are important, though—making new friends with similar interests in engineering is also an extremely valuable part of this program that I am very much looking forward to! Overall, I am seeking to gain the most knowledge and experience that I possibly can from this program. Although I do have a background in engineering and science, the most valuable quality I contribute is my dedication and passion for all things STEM. If I were to be selected for this program, I would be sure to have this love of problem solving and engineering shine through in all of my work and interactions.","By checking this box, I am electronically signing this online application and acknowledging that the information I have provided is accurate to the best of my knowledge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

",,"ENGAGE, Texas A&M College Station, A five day program that introduces students to the different fields of engineering while completing a STEM related project. ","Tinkering is what I was born to do. I have never had a moment where I am not tinkering, whether it is in my SeaPerch practice after school or in my Computer Science class. I knew that I was going to grow up to be a Mechanical Engineer when I joined my first robotics club in third grade. I was building with LEGOS programming them to complete arduous tasks and complete amusing tasks. From that moment one I spent my life working on STEM activities to have a better understanding about what it takes to be an engineer. Another reason that I want to be an engineer is because I love to travel. When I went to my first National Conference for the National Society of Black Engineers I learned how much I love to travel. So that is one of the main reason I continued to be involved in NSBE. I am now the Vice President of my chapter and I have not looked back on traveling since. I went to Singapore for a trip with NASA and that allowed me to have a better look on the world. Being an engineer is what I am. An engineer is what I want to be until I perish because the world can't survive without engineers.","During the Summer of 2016 I was in a program with IBM and the Anita Borg Institute, FOSS Saturdays. The main focus of the program was to introduce girls to coding no matter their background. There were girls from high schools from around the Houston area. The first day we had to form a team with a girl from another high school. My partner, Mia went to Clements High School and was a Senior. The tasks that we had been given was to come up with a prototype of an app that could solve a problem in our community. We were both from different communities and the only similarity that we could find in our communities was that we were both students. So we wanted to solve a problem within the student community. We realized that students get distracted by their cellphones a lot when trying to do work so we wanted to created an app that could restrict certain apps for a specific amount of time. We called our app Concentration because we wanted to make sure that students would concentrate on their homework instead of the social media and gaming apps on their phones. We had five months to work on our prototype, but in the end we created a website that could restrict the access of certain websites. The employees at IBM told us that this was a competition about three months into the program and the team that can produce the best final design would be able to attend the Grace Hopper Conference, the largest conference for Computer Science. At the end of the program all our families came and they saw us present and they told us that our group had won. ","I'm a future engineer. I have always been a mechanic since the age of eight. Being an engineer in your mind can make you one in real life. My mind has made who I am today, a hardworking, talented young woman. My interest in engineering started to blossom when I went to my first science conference and heard an Aerospace Engineer from BOEING talk to me and a group of girls about her job. I felt my brain explode with excitement when I was listening to the female engineer talking about her experiences working with the airplanes. I have always found airplanes so fascinating. Since that day I have dedicated myself to applying myself to being the best student that I could be. My dedication to my work is why I am a good fit to the C-Tech 2 Program at Virginia Tech. I will be able to further my engineering career by attending this camp because as a female interested in Engineering I know that there are not a lot of other females in the field already, so this program will make sure that I know that there are other females in the world that support and want to actually be in the field of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics.","By checking this box, I am electronically signing this online application and acknowledging that the information I have provided is accurate to the best of my knowledge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4.	Public Affairs Office - Encampment staff, VA Wing Encampment, CAP, 2015. The goal of a CAP encampment program is to train new cadets in the basics of Civil Air Patrol and to learn how to operate in a team atmosphere. Program selection process includes impromptu speech and group discussion competition, aerospace/leadership written exam and physical/drill test. Only 60 members are selected from about 200 cadre applicants. Cadre staff have to attend three full day training session prior to the commencement of the encampment. 
5.	NER- Glider Academy, CAP, Vermont and PA, 2015 and 2014. Glider flight academies, include all basic to advanced skills and ground instructions. Program selection process entails interview by senior CAP officials and aerospace/leadership written exams. I completed a “Pre-solo” in both the academies. 
","“Fuel quantity indicators? Check. Flaps secure? Check. Lights? Check. Brakes? Check.” I call out items on the pre-flight checklist just as I have been instructed. I radio air traffic control that I am ready and they respond, “NY229, Blackstone ground, proceed for take-off.” I push the throttle and I am soaring in the sky. I follow the same procedure every time I fly. And each time I take off, I directly experience how engineering has helped mankind realize the dream of flying above the clouds and beyond. 
As I advanced through the Civil Air Patrol, an auxiliary of the United States Air Force, and gained aerospace knowledge, I realized that it takes engineers from various disciplines to make an aircraft fly and I wanted to be one of them. To achieve this goal, I enrolled in a STEM-focused high school even though it required a 3 hour commute each day and pursued an intensive course load designed to support my interest in engineering. Outside of class, I studied AP Statistics independently, took a course on the fundamentals of computers and then completed AP Computer Science during the school year. I am currently working on complex projects in web and mobile development classes and plan to join the research mentorship project program next year. 
In addition to academics, I work as an Explainer at the National Air and Space Museum, 3 weekends per month and gain further appreciation for the field of engineering. I participate in all the professional development opportunities, including studying independently and attending training sessions on topics related to aeronautics and space science. 
These experiences have taught me that engineers plan, create, test and re-test ideas and theories. Engineers solve problems, and the problems I want to solve will make flying a safer and more enjoyable experience. When I am in the cockpit, going over my checklist, I want to know that my knowledge and skills as an engineer have contributed to the incomparable thrill of flying.","The summer before my junior year, I attended a weeklong session at the U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Research Development and Engineering Center (AMRDEC) in Huntsville, Alabama. I was really excited about the opportunity and dreamed of all the aviation and missile research activities I might get to work on. When I arrived at the facility, I was taken to a room with other participants. The faculty gave a presentation on simple machines. Then, we were split into three teams and were assigned to work on a “Rube Goldberg” project to turn on a light bulb. 

Earlier, during the icebreaker session, I realized that many of the participants had never done research or worked on complex science projects. I have done both and was looking forward to more challenging assignments. To my surprise, however, the project proved to be a perfect introduction to the program. Each member of the team started by sharing their ideas. Everyone listened carefully to the other person’s ideas, and nobody interrupted. Every idea was simple and easy to implement, but very well thought out. As we started building the machine, the team warmed up to each other. During the breaks we engaged in conversation about the differences in our cultures, from the fast paced life of the city to a more relaxed lifestyle in rustic Alabama. When our trials failed and the dominos flew around the room, instead of blaming each other, we laughed, regrouped, and tried again.

In the end, my team did not win the competition. But this whole experience was extremely rewarding as I learned that you do not need to have taken advanced science courses to come up with great ideas. As a budding engineer, I realized the importance of collaborating with people from different backgrounds and with different strengths. Most importantly, I learned that working with people whose aim is to learn, rather than win, produces more camaraderie in the team and a better sense of accomplishment.
","The C-Tech2 program represents an amazing opportunity for me to learn more about Virginia Tech and confirm my interest in pursuing a degree in engineering. I have experience flying and a depth of aerospace knowledge. Through the Civil Air Patrol (CAP), I have completed pre-solo on gliders and have ten hours of powered aircraft flying experience. Also, I have extensive computer science programming experience and the ability to build a robot from scrap material. My background reflects my interest in engineering, but I would like to better understand many more engineering disciplines. This program will expose me to paths and projects in engineering with which I am not yet familiar. In addition to learning more about engineering fields and concepts, C-Tech² will provide me with the opportunity to meet industry representatives and university faculty.

 As a cadet deputy squadron commander in the CAP program, I have learned to break down complex tasks, plan, delegate and manage which will help in the development of the engineering design project. At Udar-Hazy, I have worked to refine my interpersonal and organizational skills. In addition, I value diversity and am able to work with people with different skills and from different cultures. As part of the C-Tech² program, I will collaborate with other young women who are as passionate as I am about pursuing careers in many different engineering fields.

Virginia Tech’s motto is Ut Prosim, Latin for ""That I May Serve."" This belief is closely aligned with my interest in pursuing a service-oriented career. Also, during my visit in the summer to Virginia Tech, I learned about the Corps of Cadets program. I was excited to know that this would enable me to meet other like-minded students who are interested in both engineering and serving our country. Finally, the C-Tech² program offers seminars focused on the college application process. These will help me navigate the Virginia Tech early admission process in the fall.

The idea of being a girl in a STEM field used to scare me. My school never advertised the engineering classes enough for me to know about them, so I always thought I was going to go into business like my parents. At least, I had this idea until the summer before junior year.

	Last summer, my mom complained that the world was too dependent on nonrenewable sources for energy. She said that if a clean and affordable renewable source of energy was not developed soon, the global community would find itself in a crisis. I was frightened by her statements and wanted to do everything in my ability to make a difference. I thought of crazy inventions to make renewable energy, like miniature windmills and self-powered batteries. However, the more I thought of possible solutions, the more I realized that I had no clue how to make anything. This led me to choose a science fair project in the field of engineering. I recruited my friend Dina and we decided to build a miniature motor. With building any invention comes a lot of trial and error. If it wasn’t the copper wires breaking free from their tedious soldering jobs, it was the rotor coming too close to the stator. My favorite part of the experience was using a 3D printer to make the rotor. Originally, we had made the part with clay and pieces of aluminum, but once the clay dried it got very brittle. Those countless hours of working late for two months in the physics room paid off when the rotor finally turned itself for 35 seconds. I was amazed that what my partner and I had spent so much time on planning and building had actually worked. This simple project made me realize that I want to be an engineer because they are the ones who solve world problems that seem impossible. Engineers make a difference in the world, and although most Latina girls like me do not go into STEM fields, I am ready to take that leap. I want to be an engineer because I am driven to solve the insolvable, one trial at a time.
","After writing a few phrases on the board, I looked up at the clock. It was 3:05 PM, yet only 5 students had shown up. This is not good, I thought.
        	I joined the Public Forum chapter of the Yorktown High School Debate Team as a freshman and found the activity to be great. My friend Linh and I joined together and excelled at each tournament. When our coach saw our enthusiasm and determination for debate, he gave us the opportunity of being team captains our Junior year. However, he warned us that if we didn’t get new kids to join, the club would be disbanded. We figured out that the problem was that no one at school knew about debate, so we set out to make sure that every single Yorktown student knew that the club existed. 
First, Linh and I created posters with catchy phrases like “Actually win arguments against your parents” or “The season is upon us; you don’t have to wait. Come to Patriot Hall, and be a part of Debate!” to market the club. We placed the posters in popular areas around the school so that they would catch students’ attention. Second, at the first debate orientation meeting, Linh and I gave a persuasive speech about the benefits of being in the Public Forum chapter. We told everyone how much debate meant to us, and how it was fun and beneficial to join. After that initial meeting, we sent an announcement to the dailies saying when the first Public Forum meeting would be. That announcement aired 7 times in a row, ensuring that every single student at Yorktown now knew about our club. 
Now, it was the moment of truth: 3:05 PM, and only five students had shown up. Just when I was about to give up, 3:06 came. At first, one or two kids quietly started to enter the room. Then, more and more kids showed up, even in big groups. By 3:10, sixteen students had arrived. All of that hard work that Linh and I had done had finally paid off. Now, all eyes were on us. Knowing this, I smiled at Linh and queued the slideshow. “Alright, let’s begin...”"," With limited spots available, I assume that C-Tech2 is most interested in admitting young people who are excited to learn, ready to collaborate with others and serious about engineering as a possible career track. That's me. I should be selected to the C-Tech² program because I am motivated to make the most of the experience. I may have found my interest in engineering late in my high school career, but I am excited to pursue this field to the best of my ability before college. High school is all about exploring different subjects and finding what best suits a person. For this reason, C-Tech² is the perfect opportunity for me to discover what it is like to be an engineer, and what career options are available if I choose this field. 
I've had the opportunity to visit with a range of engineers at work. I’ve gotten a tour of the Tesla battery assembly plant, visited programmers in Google headquarters, and seen engineers assemble factory machines. On each visit, I was fascinated by how the engineers started their projects with a simple plan and turned their ideas into a physical result. This admiration led me to think about exploring engineering as a field of study. As I look at the camp curriculum, I find that the opportunity to see how a wind tunnel works, how a building can be designed to resist earthquakes and how an app is developed excites me. 
If I were accepted to C-Tech², I would put my leadership skills to work. Being a coxswain and leading my high school’s debate team has made me realize that the only way to solve a problem is by engaging with others. I would be a beneficial member to this program by always interacting with my peers and working with them to create the best products. Being an engineer not only requires efficiency, but t the ability to lead a team to success.To conclude, I will come C-Tech2 I will come to the camp eager to learn, ready to collaborate and open to all the new possibilities that the curriculum will offer me.","By checking this box, I am electronically signing this online application and acknowledging that the information I have provided is accurate to the best of my knowledge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many of my peers when they were young wanted to be firemen, police officers or nurses but I realized none to those careers interested me even back then. I wanted to know how stuff works.  My Dad challenged me to help him with house projects, I did not just observe him with these projects, he soon all me to use his tools. I had to prove to him I knew how it worked with simple tools before he would let me get my hands on one of those nice electric screwdrivers.  Later constantly starting taking other house hold items apart to see what was happening inside. (Sometimes I could actually put them back together.)
My parents encouraged me to try anything but I suspect they knew I had a STEM tendency. When they would take naps I would go to my ‘secret laboratory’ (my bathroom) and conduct experiments. These experiments consisted of baby powder, lotion, and whatever I could find in my bathroom. As I got older I was introduced robotics, from here my destiny was set for engineering. I soon joined school clubs and science teams which lead to competition. As the team captain, I learned how to assign tasks, manage our time and be efficient with the resources. While we did not win the demo, we learned how to work together and respect each other’s ideas and talents.  That says everything I love about engineering, working with people to solve tough problems. 
","This fall I was selected to be the team lead on a climate study for my biology class. Our assignment was to provide a study on the effect climate change could be having on the ecology within our region.  When we first met, everyone had good ideas but we had no agenda or limitations on our topics, so I began making notes on how to make our meetings more productive and I also asked our teacher about our limitations.   I made sure we always had an agenda and the team would agree on the topic. I found that the team started working better and we started making progress on our goals.  I was nervous at first, but started telling everyone how much progress we were making and how far we needed to go. We agreed on breaking up assignments to the best person for that job and I set up a “Group Me” and “Instagram” account so we could share progress and ideas on our smart phones. 

One of the challenges we face was getting accurate readings on soil moisture and temperature for our local area. However, one team member had a parent who knew a local meteorologist. He was able to point us to the websites that contained soil content information.
As we got closer to the end, it started to become difficult to sort the information, so we opened a Google hangout and Google doc so we edit and check our work together. 

I am glad to say we received an “A” on the project but even better I know who I can count on for new projects and I learned about teamwork in the class. You don’t have to be the smartest, but you have to stay focused.

","I want to go to C-tech because I want to continue learning about engineering.  The last few summers I have attended several academic camps; however, if accepted into C-Tech 2 this would be my first summer camp with a focus on engineering.  There are so many reasons I could name why I should be accepted into C- Tech2 Summer Program.  Just to name a few, unfortunately only 20 percent of engineering schools graduates are women yet women only make up 11 percent of practicing engineers.  This number could be low because of the belief women lack interest in science and engineering especially by the time we get to High School.  As an African American female myself, the numbers are even lower for this group.  Acceptance into the C -Tech 2 Program is just the first step towards my goal of becoming an engineer.  Like other young trail blazers before me:  Dr. Ayanna Howard (Roboticist), Mary Spio (Deep Space Engineer & founder of Ceek VR Inc.) and Laura Teclemariam (Software engineer for gamers giant EA) who are leading the way in various fields of engineering,  I want to know how my love for science can used as my future endeavors as an engineer.  I believe this camp will help me learn more about engineering and the various careers there are in this field.  Although the US work force may be limited with female engineers today but by 2023 there will be at least one additional engineer who is determined to make a difference.  Engineering is everywhere and I want to show it.   I think this camp will help me be able to do so.","By checking this box, I am electronically signing this online application and acknowledging that the information I have provided is accurate to the best of my knowledge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I taught the math portion using creative ways to immerse the campers into the world of Math.
This was a volunteer program.

Camp Soar (Special Olympics Athlete Retreat) is a special program for handicapped individuals who are paired with ""buddies"" to do every day things and activities such as learn how to use computers, making arts and crafts, and play all different sports with some even competing in the olympics! This was held at the Jewish Community Center of Charlotte. This is an amazing volunteer program to wish I will be a Counselor who will oversee all the groups to make sure the programs run smoothly.",I want to be an engineer to help people have a more efficient and better quality of life. My Introduction to Engineering class this year has helped me realize that my strong skills in math and physics complement the skills required in this field. I have really enjoyed our projects and have a strong interest in becoming part of a profession that advances society by designing and developing things that are useful and necessary for everyday living. Engineers have been able to come up with great and seemingly impossible feats over the past couple of year and I would really enjoy to be part of this age of developing new technologies.,"While volunteering at a camp named Camp Soar, which is a camp for people with disabilities to go and make friends and do certain activities that might not be accessible to them already, a camper started to get violent and upset about what seemed to be a small issue. His buddy tried to calm him down and distract him from the other person but when that failed she called myself and another group leader over to try to calm him down. We learned that from his caretaker that when he acts this way that it is best to just sing to him so he would calm down. Each of us tried to sing but he would just not calm down. It wasn't until all of us together started to make jokes and laugh and all sing together that we finally distracted him. We all did those exact same things on our own but we did not realize that it would not work unless we all worked together to solve the issue in front of us. This taught me that even though sometimes you believe you are capable of doing things on your own, that you always need a little extra help from those around you. Working in groups and solving problems together helps if many different ways from getting a job done more efficiently to learning other possible ways of approaching a task. ","The possibility of attending the Virginia Tech Engineering Summer Camp to learn more about different areas and opportunities within the engineering field and to spend time with current college students who are studying to become professional engineers is an exciting goal to reach. As a rising senior, I’m also looking forward to learning what I can expect from a college program and life on campus, particularly at Virginia Tech. Because the engineering program there is so well-respected and has a great reputation, it is one of my first choices for college applications this fall. This program will help me determine if the Engineering I would like to go into is the right field for me. This experience would be a once in a life time chance to help me farther understand the world of technology and all the exciting new projects that come with it!","By checking this box, I am electronically signing this online application and acknowledging that the information I have provided is accurate to the best of my knowledge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

",,"I come from an all girls school, so women in power as a great effect on me. I want to become a female engineer to prove women can do it all, to make my father proud, but more importantly to make myself proud. Growing up, I failed terribly in english and history. I always had to read stories I could not care less about, and more so now. On the other hand, everything makes more sense in math and science class. I participate more in math and science class because I actually know what I am talking about, unlike how I pretend to know the true meaning of Invictus.

With my love and knowledge of math and science, I see engineering as my future. No matter what field of engineering I desire to do, I know I will become successful and happy. Engineering is everywhere and everything and it is my dream to change the world. Whether it is the discovery of the newest cure in bioengineering or the creation of the next life-changing technology in computer engineering, I will have a huge impact on the world. 

","I am a part of the Space to Innovate Club at my school. In this student-run club, my peers and I are designing a makerspace in our school. As a part of the club, we traveled to a maker-space in Reston, Virginia. At the maker-space, we learned more about what equipment we can have in our future maker-space and the cost. At the end of the day, we were given an activity to make a device that indicates when a plants needs water. The people at the maker-space gave us a black box filled with colorful wires and tiny metal pieces. Looking at it from a first glance, I freaked out a little inside. I did not know how to put this crazy looking device together, but as we were given more instruction, it all came together. Each wire had a designated spot and the tiny metal pieces fitted perfectly, like a key to a lock. In the end, my peers and I put together a mini computer that beeps when a plant needs water or has too much. Even though this was a very small project, it was my first taste of engineering and I fell in love with it. ","For starters, I am a Hokie by blood. My dad graduated in 1985, majoring in civil engineering, and my sister will be a freshman this upcoming fall. My family and I love everything about Virginia Tech; the town of Blacksburg, the campus, and of course, the Hokie pride. To be a Hokie, is not like any other school school spirit I have seen. I believe one time my sister and I counted more Virginia Tech license plates in Charlottesville than UVA, which is incredibly sad for Wahoos.

To be a part of this program will be a turning point for my future. It will direct me into the right direction of what I want to do for a possible engineering career. It will be an honor to be selected for such an amazing opportunity.

There are an infinite amount of possibilities with what you can do or produce, which is what makes engineering stand out to me. In the field of engineering, there are so many branches to go into, and in each branch, there are still an endless amount of new discoveries or inventions to be made. The possibility that I could discover or make something life changing is what I find so intriguing about engineering. In addition, engineering allows you to solve a problem. You are given a challenge that has so many solutions and you must figure out one that will fix the problem. I want to be an engineer because I enjoy problem solving and the fact that often times, there is not only one right answer to a problem. There are many right answers and multiple ways to look at one challenge which makes engineering so appealing to me.","In my chemistry class, I had a lab where we worked in groups to use a reaction between baking soda and vinegar to fill up a plastic Ziploc bag with the most  air and in the quickest amount of time. First, we each worked together to find out how many liters the bag could hold. We then made a list of ideas for how to fill the bag without the baking soda and vinegar mixing. As a group, we picked out the best idea. Then, we worked on figuring out the theoretical amount of each substance we would need to fully inflate the bag. We split up the equations we had to do, then measured out the amount of each substance. One person measured the baking soda, one person measured the vinegar, and one person held the bag open so we could pour both in. Once we finished our first test, we talked about what might help us increase the amount of gas produced to inflate the bag, and decrease the amount of liquid product left over. We reasoned that it would be best if we added more baking soda and the bag inflated more. Some more baking soda was added and we felt that our bag was not going to get any fuller, so we decided to decrease the amount of vinegar we put in to end up with less liquid product. When that did not work, we went back to our past test and decided it was our best shot to use as our final airbag.
","I should be selected for this program because of how much it will benefit me. I enjoy engineering and I know it is the field that I want to go into, but I am not sure what type of engineer I want to become. . I would like to figure out a definite plan going into junior year and this camp would help me do that. From this experience, I hope to gain more knowledge about the different fields of engineering and more insight about what certain jobs are actually like. In addition, I would also be able to learn a little bit about what college life is like and what kind of college I want to go to. Virginia Tech is an outstanding school with really good engineering programs. I specifically liked the C-Tech 2 program as it encourages women in STEM. This program would introduce me to various fields in engineering while giving me a practical understanding. I feel that having a summer experience at Virginia Tech would help me to better define my future goals and at the same time give me a better insight into college life.

","NYLSC: This program was held in Washington D.C and leadership was the main focus of the program. As the program progressed however, it reached out to STEM professions, encouraging participants to explore carriers offered in various fields.
Envision: This program took place on the Harvard and Manhattan College campuses. Through the program, team building skills were learned as well as problem solving. With these skills, teams were made and given problems of which solutions must be found for. ","To me, engineering is a coalescence of change and creativity. From a young age, I believe the world runs like clockwork. Everyone helps everyone, and individuals, unique in their own ways, do jobs that link to others, together creating something, much like the gears working together in a clock. I see engineers as the horologists in this world of horology, modifying and aiding the world to allow everything to run as efficiently as possible. The world is forever changing, needing innovations to keep up with society changing and evolving. Innovations shape society, just as much as society influences innovations, if not more. The human mind can imagine endless possibilities for new technologies and theories. However, anyone can dream, and just as easily brush off ideas as wishful thinking, but it takes a dedicated and innovative mind to bring the object of an imagination to reality: an engineer. Engineering allows me to see the world in a new light. To every problem, there is a solution; to darkness, a light. By working hands on, I’m able to make a difference and see change occur right in front of my eyes; I can take a small step that could cause a marathon. Just the thought of creating something that has the possibility of helping those in need brings me joy. Engineering is an art form, it’s poetic and inspiring; it’s the opportunity to see and do what others don’t. In other words, I’d like to be an engineer because it gives me hope.","My freshman year, I participated in my first ever robotics competition. The competition was made up of teams that race underwater remote operated vehicles, or ROVs. By participating in the SeaPerch competition in 2014, I had the ability to build my own robot and learn more about circuitry. However, all the teams at my school had a reoccurring problem with their control boxes. After sautering the remotes, everyone would hope that they wouldn’t short circuit, but most of the time we’d have to re-sauder the entire control box. This became an inconvenience, so I began to think of how the problem could be prevented instead of fixed. One day, as I was helping another group wire their control box, I noticed that they’d flagged each wire with electrical tape. I asked them what it was for, and they responded that it was simply to differentiate the circuits. I became more curious about using the electrical tape in the remote, and went back to my group to experiment. First, we taped groups of wires together, thinking that if they were more organized then they wouldn’t touch and short-circuit. This didn’t work, so we tried stripping the wires closer to the source to prevent an excess of exposed metal; still, this proved to fail. We continued to ponder the issue, while others thought it was hopeless and continued as they were. Finally, after having a control box short-circuit for the 7th time, we figured it out. By taping each, individual wire after applying sauder, the metals couldn’t touch. It required a lot of patience and nimble fingers, but eventually we did it; we used electrical tape to create a barrier between every wire, and the box didn’t short-circuit. We told the other groups what we had done and they followed suit. All the groups went through the competition without any problems with their control boxes. Our engineering teacher went on to tell the county what we did, and the design is now implemented in all engineering programs across the county.","If I were to use this space to go into detail of why I should be selected for this program over another candidate, then I’d be writing lies coated with embellishments. I cannot provide factual evidence of why I am better than another applicant, because that is not how I think. I believe everyone who is putting forth the effort this application process requires should be granted a fair opportunity if they’re truly passionate and driven, but I know this will not be the case. So, instead of highlighting my accomplishments over another’s, I will describe why I believe I am equivalent to those students who are also driven. Upon visiting Virginia Tech for the first time, I felt like I was home; for the first time, I was surrounded by like-minded people. Being around unique minds that somehow think on the same wavelength is a beautiful thing to witness, but this program would allow me to be included, and maybe even contribute to the beauty. Every day I do my best to rise to the challenges I’m met with and strive to push myself to meet and exceed the expectations of those around me. The thought of the opportunities and challenges that C-Tech2 could introduce me to only increases my motivation to do better and be different; this program would encourage me to be unique and do my best in everything I do only further.

I have become even more passionate in this area after my involvement in Science Olympiad, science fair, my IB Design & Tech class, and by teaching robotics. There are many problems in the world right now that need to be addressed by engineers. Some of these solutions include: designing solar panels that more efficiently capture light energy, creating better medical devices that help people with heart failure, and researching new technologies to purify salt water so that there is more drinking water available in arid regions. These different problems illustrate how diverse the field of engineering is. Regardless of the challenge, the common theme is that engineers apply their skills to solve real world problems that will benefit society as a whole. I cannot imagine a more noble and enjoyable profession. Additionally, I believe there is value in increasing the number of women in engineering. Of the thirty judges at my high school science fair, I was struck that only one or two of them were women. I’ve also noticed how few women frequent NOVA labs, my community’s makerspace. I believe that there is value to our society to increase the number of women engineers.","As a member of my high school’s Science Olympiad team, I was assigned with a partner to the “Electric Vehicle” event. Our task was to create an electric car that moved as fast as possible, but stopped at a point not specified until the actual day of the competition. After we built the car, which required learning how to solder, we rebuilt it and took it apart several times, so that we knew its structure inside and out. Additionally, we learned how to mount and program the Arduino, and add/program a color sensor to stop the car. Throughout the process, we constantly tested and troubleshooted a variety of challenges. For example, the front wheels of the car were unstable, so we added a single ball bearing, which allowed the car to travel straighter. I was drawn to the programming aspect of the project, and my partner gravitated to the building aspect of it; however, we both contributed to the programming and building of the car.

We attended the Science Olympiad Invitational, where our car was disqualified because one of the loose wires disconnected from the peg, so the car would not run. It was a big disappointment, but nevertheless a good learning experience. As we focused on the Regional Competition, we better familiarized ourselves with the layout of our car. However, when we got to the regional competition, we discovered that the tape that marked the stopping point for the car was a different color than we had anticipated. Additionally, we discovered that there was a structural problem with the car, as the dowel was out of place. We decided that the best way to approach these issues was for us to play to our respective strengths. My partner handled the construction issue, while I simultaneously fixed the program so that the car would stop at the appropriate point. The car ended up stopping very close to the target point, and we medaled, placing 5th out of 26 competing teams in Fairfax County!","I have a very strong interest and ability in math and science, and am a creative problem solver. My science fair project on The Effect of Fill Density on Crush Force of 3D-Printed Cubes won first place at my high school, and received the Naval Science Award and a second place certificate at the Fairfax County Regional Science and Engineering Fair. I look forward to gaining first-hand experience learning about the many applications of engineering to today’s society. Additionally, I want to meet like-minded girls, since making friends with similar interests would broaden my experience and introduce me to problems and solutions that I had not previously considered. I enjoy working in teams, and have strong leadership skills. I lead by example and people tend to feel comfortable around me.  As the clarinet section leader for my high school’s marching band, I had a freshman band member who was struggling socially and literally did not talk at all.  I made a concerted effort to make her feel comfortable by asking her questions, including her in conversations and staying with her during breaks. She is now a confident, contributing member of my section.  These leadership skills, combined with my strong math, science and problem solving skills, make me a very strong candidate for the C-Tech² program. In addition, the C-Tech² program would be a great experience that would spur me on to become a well-rounded and strong engineering student.","By checking this box, I am electronically signing this online application and acknowledging that the information I have provided is accurate to the best of my knowledge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I give credit to this for my love of science because I would later learn how I was part of a very critical lab experiment many months before I was born.

In addition, I have had several passionate teachers who have inspired me and continue to teach me the ways in which science and math advance our society. My current chemistry teacher began his career as a chemical engineer. He has made a huge impact on the reason I aspire to be an engineer. Over the past year, he has made my passion for science grow by his teachings, experiments and  stories about some of the environmental projects he managed. Similarly, my math teacher was a mechanical engineer, and has taught me how calculus is applied to real life situations in engineering. 

In summary, my desire to pursue engineering is a true blend of my own genetic origin, my personality, and the academic inspiration I have had along the way.  I believe that as an engineer, I would be able to play a role in advancing science, making a positive impact on society just as someone else at one time did for me. While I have researched various engineering disciplines, I seek a more in depth opportunity to explore options in engineering through the summer program.  I believe this setting and hands-on format will help me to refine my knowledge, to learn more about the academic curriculum offered at Virginia Tech and to interact with the peers and faculty in this program. 
","For the past two years, I have participated in DECA. DECA is a high school program that prepares upcoming leaders and entrepreneurs for several different careers. This spring, my partner and I competed at the Virginia state conference in a hospitality and services role play. We were given thirty minutes to brainstorm ideas on how to promote a hotel and attract guests to book reservations. The hotel was a wellness resort and was set to open in 3 months. We considered various factors such as sponsors, different channels of management, promotion ideas, and several marketing strategies that applied to the hotel. After the thirty minutes passed, we took the notes we had written and sold the ideas to a judge. Our ideas varied from connections with fitness professionals to a benefit wheel with discounts and gifts for the customer's next stay. We were scored based off of creativity, expectations, and how our ideas applied to the wellness resort. We received one of the top presentation scores out of the members of my school. As the result of the competition, we were selected to go to leadership workshops at the National DECA Conference in California this Spring. Due to this experience, my partner and I learned to work well together, and to expand on each others’ ideas. DECA has played a big role in increasing my social and teamwork skills. Competing as a team through DECA has taught me how to be accepting and respectful of others’ ideas and how to collaborate with others to achieve success toward a common goal.","If I am selected for this program, I will actively engage with others, immerse myself in the school, and share my passion for science and its application in the engineering field. Attending this camp will allow me to spend time doing hands-on projects and learn from both the faculty and peers participating in the program. I will be able to apply teamwork skills by interacting with others who share my interests. Additionally, from a young age, I have grown up experiencing VirginiaTech through all the seasons; however, it was never through this angle. Both of my parents are Virginia Tech Alumni, so I was born into a Hokie household. The camp will allow me to experience a new dimension of the university that I have not seen. If I have the opportunity to view the campus from an academic perspective, I will be able to spread my passion for science and math to others in the engineering program. I believe I could contribute to this program by participating in the activities and seminars, interacting with the faculty and peers, and exploring the many paths available with others in the summer program.  I also feel that I bring a unique perspective from my own personal background on what science and engineering has meant to me and how it can significantly enhance the quality and lives of others.","By checking this box, I am electronically signing this online application and acknowledging that the information I have provided is accurate to the best of my knowledge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I want to love my job.” This answer remained vague and unclear until I took physics class. In physics I discovered that being an engineer fit my ideal job description. It has become a growing  passion for me. Being an engineer would allow me to  solve problems that can improve the quality of life. I want to have a beneficial impact on the world and not keep my successes to myself. I have always been creative and being an engineer would give me the opportunity to be a creative thinker and problem solver every day.  I enjoy working with others as opposed to working by myself. Pursuing engineering would give me the opportunity to collaborate on a daily basis not only with other engineers, but with various professions as well such as government officials, doctors, lawyers, and scientists. I have always been a hands-on, kinesthetic learner and engineering is a profession that uses this skill, keeping me involved throughout the day. I am relentless in my learning and growth because I am constantly looking for new ways to tackle problems or improve what has already been done. When I am an engineer, I will be able to expand my knowledge through my experiences with my studies and my peers. Finally, I want to be an engineer because I do not want to sit behind a computer all day. I am adventurous and ready to work with others to share my ideas as well as implement theirs so we can make the world a better place together. Engineering is something I love and am passionate about, as well as being something that I can have fun with while helping others. Without knowing it, when I had answered the unavoidable “what do you want to be when you grow up” question, I was saying I want to be an engineer.","As part of my physics class, a group of four girls including myself were challenged with the project of building a siege engine. We decided to build a catapult which we envisioned would be an easy task. We were able to make it past the designing, prototype making, and assembling steps fairly quickly and with ease, but when we tested our catapult for the first time, we soon discovered that maybe this was not as easy as we thought. Our catapult only launched the tennis ball a grand total of maybe five feet. Maybe. At first we were disappointed and frankly, quite baffled as to why our catapult did not reach the required fifteen feet after everything appeared to be going smoothly.  However, this did not discourage us. We lugged our catapult back into the workshop and began our problem solving process using the physics concepts we had learned. Our first adjustment was to extend the arm of the catapult, which proved to only add weight when launching the tennis ball. We replaced the entire arm with thinner wood hoping to see better results. After what felt like a million attempts to make changes to our catapult, we had an epiphany. What if instead of making changes to the body of our catapult, we changed the angle at which it was launched? Excited, we ran outside to the testing site and piled our backpacks under the bottom platform, making the angle of release further back.  Success! Our catapult finally launched the tennis ball beautifully while meeting the requirements. Not only did I learn useful skills to build a catapult, I found that this scenario resembled my life. Sometimes my plans or ideas work well so that I can reach a certain outcome. However, this is not always the case and by repairing my mistakes, I become a better person. I learned that it is better to have a team helping rather than taking life on by yourself in the same way that teamwork led our group to be successful because each member contributed their own unique skills that benefited our project.","I should be selected to this program because I will bring an infectious, positive energy that will ignite creativity and inquiry based problem solving.  I will also bring a high level of respect- respect for the instructors, the staff and my peers.  I am passionate about engineering. It is something I want to pursue in the future and I am excited about exploring all the aspects of it. Along with engineering, I enjoy science and math and am able to help my peers with those subjects in school. In physics I had the opportunity to design and build a siege engine with a group of my classmates which helped enhance my hands on creativity skills. I work well with others and am able to incorporate the ideas of my team members into our projects. Although I have the capabilities of being a leader and enjoy this role, I can  also be a follower when appropriate. I listen to others and take their perspective and suggestions into account. I absorb advice I receive so I can better myself as well as the projects I am working on. I work well in positive learning environments and the Hokie spirit encapsulates that. If selected, I will value my time learning and exploring at C-Tech^2 through the many activities, seminars, and projects planned. This program would be beneficial to furthering my passion in engineering as well as science and math so that I can be even more excited and hopeful for the future. The insight provided of the various engineering fields will help me select an area to pursue in college.  I want to be in a program with people who have like minds so we can work together in a fun yet educational way and help each other grow as scientists. I want to explore this newly found passion of mine in engineering.

You sit still and trust the engineer.” This quote inspires me everyday to help improve the quality of everyday life.  Ever since I was a young child I always asked about how a something works and why it did that. When my brothers pulled out the legos, I would beg them to let me use them so I could build something. One of my many characteristics is that I am ambitious and I like to be a leader. Engineering is one of the top careers that has a colossal influence on the world. To be an engineer means that I have the power, whether it big or small, to make a difference. By using my creativity and imagination I can help create and invent the future. Also, engineering would give me the chance to work with many types of people.","During my physical education class, we were told to get in groups of fifteen. Our lesson of the day was to get from one side of the gym to the other side. The issue was that we only had one pair of ‘magic shoes’. We had to pretend that the ground was hot sand, but we couldn’t walk on it unless we had the ‘magic shoes’. These shoes had particular properties,  though: they can only be worn in one direction by each member of the group, they could not be separated or thrown across the room and every member had to get to the other side.  No one could touch the ground unless they were wearing the ‘magic shoes’ and if someone were to touch it, the whole team had to go to the start line. Together as a team we created a solution and were the first and only team to get across within twenty minutes. Our solution was for all the larger, stronger team members to carry two of the smaller, lighter team members in their arms and on their back across the gym. Before walking across, everyone got into groups of three to make sure everyone could be lifted or hold on. Once those three people got across, one of the smaller members would walk back and we would repeat until all the team members got across. Together as a team, we learned that even the smaller people who didn’t seem like they could lift much were able to accomplish anything with a boost of confidence and encouragement.","As I stated in why I want to be an engineer, this is a great learning experience and provides me an opportunity to learn more about Virginia Tech and its engineering program.","By checking this box, I am electronically signing this online application and acknowledging that the information I have provided is accurate to the best of my knowledge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Everywhere I look, I see technology taking new forms, connecting the world, and achieving the impossible. It is no doubt that the world we now live in is fueled by innovation and modernization. For me, computers have always intrigued me. I am baffled at the numerous operations and problems computers can solve. Whether it is answering a simple math problem or encrypting a database, computers have transformed the way we work and live. It has opened the world to a new era of communications, connectivity, and security. Engineering is not just for those who can afford to go to an elite university, but for anyone who is willing to have patience and an open mind. Web designing is my favorite thing to do these days on the computer. I love transforming bland, boring pages to exciting, vivid canvases for people to see. For example, I run a Tumblr® blog where I design themes for members to use on their own blogs. While it is time-consuming and difficult, the end result always makes up for it. Knowing that even one member appreciates my hard-work and effort is enough to bring a smile to my face. While others might charge a fee to use their themes, mine are completely free to the public because I have been in their shoes and understand how everyone’s situation is different. I also benefit from this process because it builds up my programming knowledge and skills. Practicing makes me less prone to errors and helps me understand why things work the way they do. The field of engineering is the field I have set my eyes on. I plan on majoring in Computer Science in college and getting a job in a related field after graduation. I believe C-Tech2 will be a great program that will aid me in achieving that goal.  ","Every year, local schools in the Northern Virginia area attend the regional Seaperch® tournament. The Seaperch program allows high school students to build underwater Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) and compete against other schools. Last year, I had the wonderful opportunity of being captain of a group in our school known as “Dripping Droids.” As captain, it was my responsibility to make sure my team was organized and prepared to compete in less than five months. However, before we could even begin, we faced our first major obstacle. We were told that the kits needed to build our robots would be delayed. Already on a tight schedule, this information was a major blow to us. I knew we couldn’t let this setback hamper our spirits and prevent our progress. Instead of accepting this bad news, I decided to turn it into something positive. Without our kits, we could focus on other aspects of the completion, such as design, poster, and notebook completion. With old PVC pipes, we brainstormed possible designs and effective solutions for our robot. We were finally able to create a design that conserved our resources and operated effectively. The extra time also allowed us to organize our scientific notebook. We kept daily journals of progress, wrote down new vocabulary we learned, and embedded pictures of ideas we came up with. This helpful resource allowed us to have a reference in case a problem was to arise. Finally, the delay made it possible for every team member to have a specific task. Everyone had a task, be it in design and improvement, journaling, or creating the poster. When our kits finally arrived, we were surprised at how smooth the process was! Early planning made it possible to assemble and get to testing underwater right away. We finished well in time for the regional competition without any major problems. By having a positive mindset and keeping our eyes on the goal, we achieved success and learned an important lesson along the way.","Virginia Tech’s summer engineering program, C-Tech², would be the perfect program for me because it aligns with what I plan to study after I graduate high school. Virginia Tech is renowned for their Engineering Department and I would love to see first-hand what makes their engineering program so great. Last year I was blessed with the opportunity of attending my high school’s first CyberCamp summer program. CyberCamp was introduced earlier in the year by the Virginia Department of Education to introduce students to the field of cybersecurity, engineering, and technology. Because the state paid for all expenses, CyberCamp allowed me to attend my very first summer camp since coming to the United States in 2010. It was an eye-opening experience and deepened my love for technology. C-Tech² will give me the opportunity to meet new people who share my interests and goals. It will also allow me to explore parts of Virginia I have never seen, such as Blacksburg. Most importantly, C-Tech² will allow me to learn new concepts, try new experiments, and explore what the world of engineering has to offer. As surprising as it is, I love to learn. I don’t get good grades to boast about it but rather because, well, I just really have great passion for learning! Whether it’s for school, the Scholastic Bowl Team, or just for the fun of it, knowledge is something I am deeply interested in. The digital age we now live in makes it possible to learn whatever you want, whenever you want. Life in the United States is very different from Ghana, were most of the information students get comes from textbooks. It has opened many doors and opportunities for me and my siblings. C-Tech² is one of those opportunities and I hope I am selected to participate in the program this summer because it will be one I will not forget.","By checking this box, I am electronically signing this online application and acknowledging that the information I have provided is accurate to the best of my knowledge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This camp teaches about some of the different fields in engineering, and provided some activities related to these fields, for example, building a model rocket for aerospace. This camp focused on girls who want to go into engineering, and different opportunities for them.","     I have always been fascinated by how things work and have always wanted to figure them out and improve them. I also adore math and science and excel in both fields, and I have since I was young, so I have always wanted to enter a STEM field. As I got older, I took a liking to discovering the inner workings of different machines. I want to improve the workings of current machines we have and perhaps create my own to improve the world. I would love to work with reusable fuels and renewable resources to enhance what we have already created and work to ameliorate our atmosphere and environment.
     I officially decided I wanted to be an engineer when I was in sixth grade. My school had a math and science night, and the robotics team from a nearby high school had a table set up. They had several circuit boards out and a few other projects they had built. I was extremely fascinated by their projects, and I realized I wanted to build my own contraptions.","     One time I had to solve a problem as a team was during Physics in school. We often have lab projects in groups where we have to perform an experiment and respond to questions that relate to the experiment. For one lab, however, we basically had to answer the question and then run the experiment. We were given a marble and a ramp to put on our table to complete the lab. The directions were for our group members to measure the length and height of the table and the ramp, then use those measurements to estimate where on the ground the marble would land when rolled from the top of our ramp. Our group had to work together to find the proper measurements and plug into the proper equations.
     The first time we completed our calculations and our teacher set the cup down at the spot we had determined, the marble landed in a different spot. My team members and I had to figure out what caused the difference and fix the issue. We first reviewed our equations, and how we plugged in our values. After determining we had calculated correctly, we determined that our measurements had to be incorrect. To assist in our measurements, we used colored tape to mark the positions of our materials and to avoid any shifting that may have affected our end result. We then measured the distances again, and double checked our measurements. After we got our new distance for where our marble would land, we measured out the length on the ground and marked the spot with tape, so we could be sure the cup was placed at precisely the right place. We ran the test again, and the marble landed directly in the cup.","     I am a hard worker and well organized when I begin a project. I am excellent in mathematics and in science, and I love working in these fields. I am currently in Calculus so I am clearly able to work with mathematics that are far ahead of the expected level for people my age. I am also in AP Physics which shows that I am able to work with advanced science concepts as well. I have been keeping my grades up in both of these courses, having had an A in Physics all year and bringing my B+ up to an A in Calculus after the first grading period, which further proves my aptitude for STEM fields. Engineering fascinates me, and I am excited to study it in college and work in the field in my adult life. I have a optimistic attitude which would contribute positively to the overall atmosphere of the program.","By checking this box, I am electronically signing this online application and acknowledging that the information I have provided is accurate to the best of my knowledge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

","UMD Intermediate CyberSTEM Camp at University of Maryland Cybersecurity Center: A one week summer program at University of Maryland that provided hands on activities to learn, explore, and apply STEM and cyber security skills.","          Ever since I could just barely walk, I loved to take on challenges. For Christmas, my parents would always get me hands on toys that had some logic mixed in them. Whether it was Legos or puzzles, I always had the need to be doing something that would push me to think outside the box. Personally, I enjoy exercising my brain and challenging myself mentally trying to come up with as many as solutions as possible, figure out the most convenient solution, and create a solution that has never been made before. 

          Following the same routine over and over again without much interaction would not be my cup of tea. I see myself in the future working with people of all kinds and cooperating with them to build up the best possible solution. Putting ideas together and understanding others perspectives on ways to get to the answer intrigues me. Even if I try to make up every solution possible, somebody can always come up with something new. Engineering requires creative and new ideas to solve the problems of the world today as efficiently as possible, and not just any problems, the biggest problems. Once there is a solution, there is always another problem waiting to be solved. This is the hardest challenge out there and I want to face it. It would bring me and my mentality to a whole new level which will allow me to leave my mark on the world. 

          I want to be an engineer because I naturally love to solve logistic problems, especially real world application ones, and I have fun challenging myself. Not only that, but I would be constantly interacting and communicating with people and solving endless solutions. Engineering best fits with me and suits my personality and if I were an engineer, I know that there is not one day that I would ever regret it. ","          In early March of this year, my computer teacher took some of us to one of the toughest computer competitions in the county. As we were waiting for the buses, my team hit a bump in the road. The third person of our team was unable to attend, so my other team member and I went on the bus thinking we were going to have to participate as a two member team. To go to the competition, we went with two other schools and as it turns out, another school had a one man team. We were very excited to hear this because both of our schools could combine and we could have a full team again. It was a win-win for both schools. As we were deciding our game plan, we found out that our newest team member had one year of experience while we had two. It was a bit of a setback because he only knew how to program in C++ and we were planning to code in Java so it would be more convenient. 

          After discussing it for a while, we came to the conclusion that since I took C++ the year before, that our new member and I could pseudo code together while my other teammate could start working on one of the harder codes using Java. Since I can translate C++ to java fast and I always pseudo code before programming it made sense for me to be the bridge that could allow all of us to collaborate effectively. All in all, we were able to properly finish four of the six programs, but we were not able to place. Winning was not as important as I thought it was; I realized the skills and real life team work that I was exposed to was a better prize. It was nice to know what it is like to work with people of different skill sets and strengths and how we can put them to good use. 
","          Right now, I know, that in my future, I want to use my knowledge in math and computers to help solve solutions because today, those are the subjects I enjoy and excel in. I love to learn and teach myself new ideas in those subjects whenever I have free time. Working on solutions and challenges relax me, so it just makes sense for me to apply for C-Tech2. This program fits perfectly with my career goals which would highly benefit me and it would bring me to my greatest potential. 

          It is the time for me to start planning and working for my future. I know I want to be a part of the IT world when I am older, but engineering has so many fields, that it is very difficult to pinpoint exactly what I should focus on. At C-Tech2, I would be given the opportunity to participate in activities, learn about the different engineering departments at Virginia Tech, understand how scholarships and the admissions office run there, and my favorite reason of all, work and interact with others. 

          I like the approach that C-Tech2 takes to help the women of the future generation have an amazing opportunity to be introduced to the possibilities of their futures and it takes the time to show girls how to reach their goals. I enjoy getting to know and work others to solve solutions, I want to be exposed to all the different opportunities in the world, and I want to know how I can work on my goals to achieve the best future possible for myself.  I believe I should be selected for this program for the reason that I would utilize it tremendously and it would help me reach and discover an even better version of myself.","By checking this box, I am electronically signing this online application and acknowledging that the information I have provided is accurate to the best of my knowledge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Puzzles intrigue me and solving problems gives me a rush of excitement and satisfaction. I have also always enjoyed creating things with my hands and brainstorming new designs. My numerical and spatial aptitudes guided me toward the field of engineering, however, I was unsure of which branch to pursue until I watched the Paralympics for the first time last summer. It amazed me that the disabled athletes did not view their disabilities as setbacks, but rather as something to overcome. They had to train harder than most athletes in order to strengthen their paralyzed bodies. When I saw the determination in their eyes and the joy in their hearts when they stood on the pedestals, I realized that those athletes are the kind of people I want to help in the future. Part of the reason they were able to achieve their dreams was through the impressive technology customized to fit their bodies. Blade prosthetics enabled track stars to run faster than ever before. Cutting-edge wheelchair designs enabled the basketball teams to move around the court with more precision and speed. Hi-tech swim caps granted visually-impaired swimmers the ability to know when to turn at the end of a lane. These amazing technological aids inspired me to consider Biomedical Engineering as a future career. One of my greatest desires in life is to make an impact in this world by helping people. Injuries and disabilities often become setbacks in athletes’ careers, but I hope to design medical devices in the future that could help those athletes pursue their dreams. ","In my freshman year of high school, my English teacher recommended that I read the book If You Find This Letter by Hannah Brencher. The book told the story of a young, depressed girl in New York City who started writing letters and leaving them around the city for strangers to find. Her story truly inspired me to impact my school in a similar way. According to a study conducted by the American Psychological Association, the stress levels of teenagers are significantly higher than adults. High school brings unnecessary pressures upon students such as the pressure to maintain a high GPA and class rank, and peer pressure along with pressures that teens might have at home. Oftentimes, these pressures can lead to mental health conditions, self-harm, and even suicide. When I transferred to a public school from being homeschooled, these facts and statistics haunted me. It pained me to see the hurt and trouble that many kids my own age faced and I wanted to help them in any way possible. Hannah Brencher’s unique idea inspired me to start something similar in my school. I gathered a few friends together and shared my plan to write letters to students. The letters included inspiring quotes, our own personal stories, and encouraging messages. We folded up each letter and placed them in discreet places: in desks, tucked behind the faucets in bathrooms, and on top of water fountains. I devised a system and assigned certain trusted people to write the letters, some to deliver them, and others to help manage our social media accounts. The team that I had assembled agreed to remain completely anonymous so that the focus would not be on us, but rather on the impact the letters could produce. The impact was truly amazing and several students posted about the letters on social media saying they were deeply touched. My friends and I continued to work as a team by writing handwritten letters through the years to encourage students and to combat the negative influences in school.","Biomedical Engineering is a branch of engineering that I am currently considering, but I am open to exploring other branches to find the best fit. It is a daunting task reading a list of the numerous types of engineering degrees, but having the hands-on experience of each type would certainly provide clarity as to which interests me the most. C-Tech^2 would grant me the opportunity to explore the vast field of engineering and narrow my decision. I would also be able to meet other girls with similar interests and the desire to change the world. Virginia Tech is my #1 college and I look forward to what it would be like to live on campus and be a Hokie first-hand. Over the past three years of my high school career, I have taken three different engineering courses at my school. This year I am the only girl in my class, which can be somewhat frustrating at times, however, I do not let this deter me from pursuing my interests. At C-Tech^2, I hope to meet female engineering students who are excelling in a predominantly male career field. 

Having held various leadership positions in my high school along with being a member of several clubs and extracurricular activities, I have learned how to balance being a leader and a team player. I am open to hearing every person’s opinion, rather than being the sole decision-maker. My outgoing personality gives me the courage and ability to take a lead when needed and I love experiencing new situations and building relationships with new people.  My experience of being on the Student Council Association for the past two years has especially helped me gain these skills. 

I believe that my interest in the engineering field along with my skillset would make me an ideal candidate for C-Tech^2. By attending this program, I hope to broaden my understanding of engineering and narrow my search by seizing this opportunity to provide insight into my future career.

From an early age, I appreciate science as well as math and want a career related to those subjects. An engineer uses math, science and art to design and build different infrastructures. Using the ability to solve complex situations and implement solutions in a practical and cost effective way allows to face various problems and translate them into reality. This enables me to always stay inquisitive and analytical. I want to become a civil engineer that maintains and adapts the infrastructures we use today so that it stays effective when facing population growth and climate changes. I am interested in learning about the factors that affect a building and how one is able to use math and science to eliminate those factors. I want to become an engineer so that I am able to collaborate and be provided with different perspectives of professionals (architects and constructionists).","A time I worked in a team to solve a problem was in Chemistry class. Each group had a separate experiment to complete and had to find law that proved it. In my group, we had stuck a candle onto the bottom of a petri dish and filled it with water. We lit up the candle and placed a graduated cylinder on top which caused the water in the petri dish to transfer into the graduated cylinder. For this experiment, my group and I listed the constants of the experiment. This allowed to eliminate several of the laws we had learned. We then figured out the independent/dependent variables and concluded that the law used to prove the experiment was Boyle’s Law. I chose to write about this situation because I appreciate how well my partners and I communicate with each other. Although we argued about some of the constants, we justified our thoughts and came to a conclusion. If one did not understand why a factor was a constant, the other would tell them how/why it is, therefore it also helped to improve our understandings of the different laws.","I should be selected for this program because I am a hardworking person and devoted to my goal of becoming a civil engineer. I am a person with good communication skills and will commit to maintain the healthy working and learning environment. I will constantly find new ways to fix problems and do my utmost best on every assignment given. I am a creative and versatile person who understands the bigger picture. Although I do not have as much knowledge about engineering as others, I will actively engage in all activities and show continuous improvement of myself and other students. I will be inquisitive and ask questions about material I do not understand. This program will allow me to better understand and visualize applications of engineering to real world situations, therefore I will have more knowledge and experience about becoming an engineer.","By checking this box, I am electronically signing this online application and acknowledging that the information I have provided is accurate to the best of my knowledge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have wonderful scientists developing great ideas in their labs; however, there would be no one to turn these ideas into real life projects. Engineers help our communities improve and innovate. This is why I want to be an engineer. I want to make a difference in the world and truly help in progress of humanity. 
One of my favorite movies in the recent months is Hidden Figures. Engineers had a major part in designing a perfect spacecraft, which allowed for humans to survive the scorching heat upon re-entry into Earth’s atmosphere. Engineers came together in the movie to solve the practical problems in design, leaving behind their social and cultural differences. 
Engineers help with the smallest things in our life today. They are builders, designers, problem solvers, and practical thinkers. They make science and research actually work for mankind, turning theory into reality. I could even argue that engineering is probably most impactful profession, even more than medicine.
Engineering make extremely successful entrepreneurs in the world. For instance, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and Larry Page have created world’s most successful companies that brought innovative products to the global market. 
I want to push the boundaries and do the unexpected. Engineering studies will empower me to understand the theoretical sciences and turn them into products and services. There is so much more to discover and develop, and as an engineer, I wish I would be in the forefront of these exciting explorations.","In our school club called Model United Nations, we debate about major social and economic issues affecting the world today. In one such debate about pollution, there were two groups of five students each. One group was representing the developed countries causing pollution, which is affecting the underdeveloped countries. My group was representing the not fully developed countries being hurt by pollution and insensitive attitude of the developed countries. My group came up with an option that the developed countries pay certain amount of money to help underdeveloped countries save themselves from pollution, and the developed countries should, within 5 years, reduce their pollution drastically. However, the other group pushed back because they said the underdeveloped countries should be responsible for their pollution and try to fix themselves. We had a long and tedious debate, and finally we came up with a consensus that the developed countries will pay the money to underdeveloped countries, and will get 8 years to reduce their pollution. Debate is fun, but also helps me learn and develop as a person. I understood that listening and observing is a key quality one needs to have in order to cooperate with other people and hear their ideas about the situation. However, it also taught me that one cannot stay quiet the whole time or else other people take over and one’s ideas get overlooked. So one should have the right balance of attentiveness and argumentative skills. I enjoy working in groups because I get exposure to different thoughts and opinions that allow for me to choose the right ideas.","STEM studies excite me and give me the drive to pursue a career in technology. I excel in math and science programs at school and they have developed my interest in STEM a great deal. In Science National Honor Society, I was able to get experience in helping elementary school children understand the value of science while completing entertaining experiments. This program will help me to broaden my knowledge in engineering. 
This program empowers women to pursue careers in engineering. There have been a significantly higher percentage of men pursuing an engineering career than women. In order to bring about a change, programs like this will give exposure and broadens girl’s career options. Similarly, I started a club at my school called Girls who Code, which exposes girls to computer science and empowers alternate career options in technology for them. I would love to be a part of another program that empowers women and allows them to achieve their dreams.
Most importantly this program gives me an opportunity to experience college life at one of the most beautiful campuses. It will be a great opportunity to interact with students and professors at Virginia Tech. I will get to live in a dorm, enjoy meals from best-rated college campus cafeterias, and have fun with a whole new group of friends I make. It will allow me to meet and work with students who have similar interests in engineering, and will share a bond of our love of technology.","By checking this box, I am electronically signing this online application and acknowledging that the information I have provided is accurate to the best of my knowledge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is interesting, due to how it lets you be creative while challenging your mind. While engineering, you are able to learn how things work together to make something bigger. It makes you think and be logical, which is an aspect that I want to incorporate into my career. For example, both of my parents are engineers and they love their jobs. My Dad designs cash registers, and my Mom designs computer servers. When I grow up, I don’t know what type of Engineer I want to be, but I am willing to try all of them.
In school, I do well in math and science classes and enjoy learning new things in them. While I want to be an engineer for those reasons, the main thing that makes me want to become an Engineer is the process of how an idea in your head is turned it into something that is usable in the real world. This process of creating entities that could be used to help people is awe-inspiring. ","My school is a Project based learning school so we do a big project every year. In 7th grade, the year my school was founded, we did a project about a trip to an exotic island where we would have to live for a year. We were able to take a large boat to the island so our group had to plan how to pack supplies needed into the boat and what to take with us and what kind of government we would have on our island. This was an example of the type of project that we do every year at school. Even though we have a big project every year we also do smaller projects throughout the year. 
For example, most recently we did a project in biology where, before we took notes concerning DNA, we had to determine whether or not DNA was made of proteins. In this mini project we had four people and one hour in order to solve this problem. Hence we separated the project into sections based one aspect of the problem for a person to work on. I worked on the structure of DNA and Proteins, how they were structured similarly or very differently. There were three other people in the project each tasked with an aspect of the problem. Paige (one of the people in my group) concentrated her research on the scientific definition or usage of DNA. Charisma researched a scientific experiment on the make-up and discovery of DNA. While Alex investigated the scientific importance of the information that we were finding. Lastly once we got all of our info we came to a conclusion, DNA is not made of proteins. We then bestowed our findings to the class, each presenting our part of the knowledge.","Engineering is exciting and will be fun to learn about. I want to learn more about engineering to discover the different types of engineering. Recently I went to New York on a school trip and was very impressed by the structural engineering. I want to build things to inspire people to change the world. When engineering something you can make mathematical and scientific breakthroughs through logical and critical thinking. When people work together to try to accomplish a task, it will be more successful than if just one person was working to complete the task.
Furthermore, I was the president of my school’s Senior Beta Club last year and enjoyed leading my classmates. Last year in the Senior Beta Club we went to the Beta Club convention and helped sort food for the local food bank. I have a lot of practice when it comes to working with groups, I have played soccer for 8 years now and still enjoy playing with teammates. Most of all I love learning through projects or problem solving.","By checking this box, I am electronically signing this online application and acknowledging that the information I have provided is accurate to the best of my knowledge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A major milestone in a dancer’s life is when she gets her first pair of pointe shoes, allowing her to dance on her toes. When I was twelve, I finally got my first pair. However, it was not as fun as I expected it to be. The shoes were very uncomfortable, I got blisters, and to top it all off, they wore out in a matter of weeks. After several other unsuccessful pairs, I finally discovered one particular brand, whose mission was to take an engineering approach to the shoe’s construction. Essentially, they took into account all of dancers’ common complaints and created an improved design. The company was willing to go against the traditional standard, changing such design features as the materials it was made of and the way in which it supported the foot. For the first time I had a shoe that was more impact-absorbent, lasted a long time, and helped with proper alignment.
These pointe shoes have become immensely popular among students and professionals worldwide. This shows the power of engineering: being able to analyze a problem and then build a solution for it, thus improving people’s lives. In this case, most dancers had just accepted that pointe shoes were going to give them blisters and hurt their feet, making the emergence of this modern take on a 19th century design, revolutionary. This experience has shown me how engineering can help reinvent how we live our lives. 
I haven’t had many opportunities at school to explore engineering, but from experiences such as dance, I have really formed an appreciation for what engineers do and what difference they can make. I really enjoy math, science, and logic puzzles, and I want to learn more about how these subjects can be applied to real world problems. One day I hope to be able to make an impact as significant in someone’s life as that pair of pointe shoes had for me. 

","One of the most challenging, yet rewarding experiences was my first introduction to robotics. My friends and I had found a tutorial online, and we had spent the previous week gathering the materials to build the robot. It had seemed simple enough: you had to attach a few wires here, solder some things together, and then you would have a small robot. However, we ran into a few roadblocks along the way. 
Firstly, we couldn’t get the battery and the motor to work. When we hooked it up, the battery started smoking because of a faulty motor. We replaced it, thus fixing the problem. Also, none of us had much experience with soldering, so it took some teamwork to solve these various problems and to get the robot to work the way we wanted it to. This took some time, but otherwise we would not have been able to put the robot together. Our four-person team split up the work, so we had one person figure out the wiring, another to focus on the motor, and another friend and I mastered soldering. 
We learned a lot along the way, both through the experience itself and also through the tutorial, which explained some of the technicalities of electricity and magnetism. Also, although we had the tutorial, there was still a good deal of problem solving involved. In the end, we had a robot that could move around and turn. Although the sensor-based turning was not quite working well, it was still exciting to have something that we built. 
","From a very young age I’ve loved solving puzzles. This love for innovation and problem solving soon evolved into a passion for STEM. The C-Tech^2 program would be the perfect opportunity to expand on my interests. It would be really interesting to interact with people from across the state who share my passion for STEM.
Although I enjoy all branches of STEM, the one I am most interested in is engineering. It is really amazing to be able to create something that could help solve important problems that our world faces today. I believe that STEM is not strictly math and science but it is how you apply these skills to make something greater. I think that the C-Tech^2 program will help me learn about some of the many interdisciplinary applications of math and science. I’m excited to extend my learning beyond the classroom, and gain more hands-on experience. I want to know how equations and theory apply to real life problems and situations, because that’s where it really matters.
I should be selected for this program because I enjoy logical thinking and working with technology. I am excited to learn more about different kinds of engineering and work together in teams. I’m still unsure what kind of engineer I’ll be, but if I had the opportunity to attend the C-Tech^2 program, I think I’d become closer to finding out.

I possess both artistic and creative talent and would like to make use of them.  I am, however, a practical person who realizes that few have truly successful artistic careers. 

I’d like to use both my brain and my hands to create objects that would be of benefit to others. I want to be physically active and mentally engaged in activities that allow my ingenuity to shine through. I want to make a difference in the career I choose. 

The discipline of engineering is very broad and includes numerous specialties. Civil engineering interests me because of my affinity for architecture and design and the ingenuity possessed by mechanical engineers is impressive. A year of general engineering will definitely benefit me while searching for the perfect fit for my interests.

Engineers collaborate in their daily work. This is a plus for me – I enjoy being around people and sharing ideas with them. This makes for a dynamic work environment that is far from boring. This fact, along with the ability to create things that benefit society – be it an environmentally designed building or a prosthetic limb – interests me.

I am aware that engineering is a demanding major. One has to be willing to work hard and persevere through the difficulty of much of the course work. I feel that, for me, the rewards of an engineering degree and subsequent career are well worth the struggle. The underrepresentation of women in engineering provides the perfect opportunity for me. I will be sought after by employers and appreciated for the unique female perspective that I will bring to my field. 

Engineers are highly regarded in today’s society and I will be very proud to succeed in such an awesome profession. Hopefully, I will be given the opportunity to accomplish my goal.
","I have been more involved with group work during my junior year of high school than during the previous two years. Numerous group projects are part of the curricula of my AP courses.

My most demanding class is AP Physics and it is also my most collaborative. My teacher, Mr. Nogay, encourages group work as a way of increasing student participation and effectiveness.  He has spoken with us about individual student responsibility in the group, as well as division of tasks and treating each other with respect.

The bulk of class time in physics is taken up with labs and practice problems. Both require me to work together with my tablemates. Shortly before winter break, Mr. Nogay assigned a lab in which we had to conduct elastic and inelastic collisions using two carts, a track, and two photogates. It took our group half the class time to simply set up the experiment on our first try. Another setback occurred when the data we collected turned out to be incorrect.  

Learning from our mistakes, we subsequently pinpointed problem areas and reassigned some tasks. It then became clear we had not followed the set up instructions as directed, placing the carts at incorrect starting points. This correction in the dynamics of the experiment led us to the collection of erroneous data. Fine-tuning our group dynamics greatly improved our group functioning and subsequent results. Collaborating with my team members has given me more confidence in expressing my opinions and becoming a more active, open-minded student.
","I spent my elementary school years in a small school with 50 students in each grade level. In need of a change, I opted to attend a big public high school with 2500 students. I decided that the opportunities at Oakton High School were worth the initial ‘culture shock’ I would experience. I negotiated the hurdles well and have been flourishing since my freshman year.

I work hard to maintain a 4.1 GPA in honors and AP courses. I was inducted into the National Honor Society this year, play a varsity sport and participate in several clubs. I have shown myself to be ‘up to the challenge’ and am now ready to challenge myself once again. It will hopefully be at a school like Virginia Tech with an outstanding engineering program. The C-Tech2 Program is a good starting point for my future college experience.

I have artistic talent that will contribute to my engineering career. Engineering is not all about math. If that were the case, I can foresee engineers being replaced in the not so distant future by computer programs.

A computer program does not possess sparks of creativity that artists possess. Studies show that artists’ brains have increased neural matter in areas related to fine motor and visual imagery.  The visual imagery linked to creativity is a skill that benefits engineering and creates beautiful buildings and remarkable bridges. 

I appreciate your consideration of my application for the C-Tech2 Program. I will be an asset to the program and I know that I will learn a lot and really enjoy myself.

I particularly enjoy biology and physics; to the extent I’ve chosen for all my science classes to be honor level classes. I currently am leaning towards studying biology or pre-vet, but I would like to see the possibilities that engineering has. Bio-engineering is something that is also very interesting since it combines biology and engineering.","In physics once we worked as a team to build a structure made of spaghetti and marshmallows while competing against other teams to build the tallest structure. We had a limit of 20 spaghetti strands two marshmallows, a planning period of 10 minutes and a building period of 20 minutes. Our team decided to plan and sketch everything out first so when we started building it wouldn’t be absolute chaos. Working as a team helped since we all had different ideas of how to make it tall and sturdy, using that as an advantage we ended up combining most of our ideas to create a hybrid structure. We strongly believed if we used elements of all our ideas that our structure would be superior and stand because of the different aspects incorporated. In the end our structure ended up being weak and short because we ran out of time, but we still all found the project enjoyable. I wish we had listen to one guy in our team because he had suggested simplifying the structure to save time to make sure we wouldn’t run out. To accomplish our task better our team should’ve simplified it, we ran out of time and not even one thirds of the structure we had planned was built. If we had taken the time to listen I believe we could’ve easily won with the tallest structure. I learned that you should listen to everyone even if you believe that everything is under control and can be easily managed.",Virginia Tech is my first choice for school no matter what program I end up wanting to go into. Being in this program would allow me to learn more about Tech and I could explore engineering as a career path.

Growing up as a female who is strong in both math and science everyone kept telling me different fields of work that I should look into, however, I was able to adventure on my own and find the career of engineering and instantly knew how perfect this career would be for me. The idea of being able to use science, math, and technology to solve problems and improve the way of living fascinates me because I believe that the world is how it is today because of engineers and their creations. As a female, I have been told to maybe look into other fields of work because of how male-dominated this field is, but I believe that my gender should not decide how successful I am in engineering, but rather my hard work and ideas. Being able to learn how things work, how they are made, and how they can be improved upon makes me realize how important science and math are to helping to develop better ways to think about things. I want become an engineer because I see the importance of a growing technological world and I believe that I can become someone who can make an impact in this developing world.","I have had the opportunity to attend a magnet-based high school and be in a STEM based program that allows hands on activities and class projects with smaller groups. As a sophomore, I was taking a Drafting class and our end of the semester project was to measure and draw the school’s auditorium/theater in Auto-CAD. Being a small class of only 10-12 people, each of us had specific roles in the project. As with all projects, you have your weak links, but I decided to step up and become one of the leaders in the class to make sure everything was done correctly and on time. Since I had taken the class second semester, our big goal was not to draw the auditorium from scratch, but it was to correct first semesters drawings. This at first did not seem to be the hardest project that I have been assigned, but it did prove itself to be the most time intensive and detail orientated project I have worked on in my high school career. As I said previously, we had a class of around a dozen people, however only about half of the class dedicated themselves and worked on the project rigorously. I was at the advantage in the project because I am also involved in the technical theater program and I was able to use my knowledge of both this and drafting to become a well informed leader in the project. After around three intense weeks of drawing and making sure the plans were correct, we were able to help out the technical theater department with our drawings that would help them plan more space effective sets and designs.
","I would love to be selected for this program because it would help me further advance my knowledge in the engineering field and also help me decide which discipline is best for me personally with hands on experience. I think I would also bring valuable assets to the teams created at this program such as good leadership and creative ideas. As a high school junior, I have been looking into different colleges close to me and would love to be able to explore the different types of engineering programs at Virginia Tech along with being able to explore the campus itself. Another reason as to why I think I should be selected for this program is that being a female trying to go into a STEM field is becoming more difficult because of how male dominated it is and I would love the opportunity to meet and interact with other girls interested in the same career as I am along with current students and professors at Virginia Tech that could help influence me and my decision of becoming an engineer. Being selected for this program would be such an honor, but I believe that I would be a good fit for this camp as someone who is well rounded and would love to learn more about becoming an engineer.

These innovations are just a small example of how elements of the STEM fields can merge, making our world an exciting and progressive place. I want to be an engineer so that I can empower myself while creating new innovations and break limiting preconceptions. 

Becoming an engineer would allow me to pursue a career that would excite me and expand my horizons. I love problem solving and working on a project helps me integrate both creative and critical thinking skills. I am able to thrive when posed with challenges and my extroverted personality makes me love working with a team in order to accomplish a greater cause. I have a passion for arts and design and also appreciate the concrete figures of math. Engineering is the best of both words, allowing me to push boundaries through innovation. As a girl, I want to break the stereotype of male dominance in STEM fields and prove that girls can do anything they put their minds to and excel. This further fuels my determination to succeed. I would love to be an engineer because I have a passion for STEM fields and I see engineering as an amazing profession that would allow me to explore the things I love. ","For my capstone project, I worked with a team to build a library for ForKids, a local homeless shelter. Our goal was to give the children and teens in the shelter a place to relax and unwind as well as to promote literacy. Especially with the difficulty of being in and out of homelessness creating extremely unfavorable situations, we knew what a positive impact books could have on a child's life. As a group of bookworms, we knew the therapeutic power of reading as well as the power that knowledge can give. Knowing this, we worked hard together in order to make our project a success. The girls in my group had contrasting personalities creating an interesting group dynamic. While there were some conflicts over our ideas on how to most effectively influence the children in he shelter, by the end of the project, we had created a tight bond by working through many different problems. A major problem in our project was finding quality supplies and an efficient design that would hold the hundreds of books that we had collected through various book donations. We learned that by being resourceful we could use innovative ways to create sustainable furniture that would be able to work in the demanding environment of a homeless shelter. We used different boat parts to create sturdy child- proof furniture and used technology to create a database similar to the ones used in libraries so that we could catalog the books. As a team, we were able to overcome many challenges and setbacks to complete a project that will have a lasting impact on not only us, but also the children of ForKids. 
","I am an amazing candidate for this program because I am very enthusiastic and outgoing allowing me to bring diversity to any team. I am a natural leader and I love problem solving as well as creative thinking especially when collaborating with others. I enjoy technology and engineering and would benefit immensely from all the experiences I would gain by being in this program. If I attended CTech2, I would be able to have an extraordinary time that will help me grow as a student. In addition, meeting industry representatives will allow me to gain insight about an engineering profession and being on campus with allow me to experience college life. Since I am considering a future in engineering, this would also allow me to interact with others having similar interests and explore the engineering program at Virginia Tech.

","Ever since I can remember, I have always enjoyed math and science and have found these subjects to be intuitive. One of the reasons that I am interested in pursuing a career as an engineer is because I excel in math and science and want to use my ability in those subjects to contribute something concrete for the betterment of society. I first became interested in engineering after my parents recommended that I explore engineering as a career option and I have taken proactive steps to do that. During 10th grade, I attended the Widener University Engineering Mini-Camp for High School Girls and took the Explore Engineering course on Canvas.net. In addition, last summer I was chosen to participate in the Penn Summer Science Initiative, a tuition-free program sponsored by the Penn Materials Research Science and Engineering Center, which is funded by the National Science Foundation. I have also participated in the Pennsylvania Junior Academy of Science Fair every year since 7th grade and have advanced to the state competition four out of the five years.

Based on my research, engineers seem to work within teams to solve problems together which is another reason that I want to pursue engineering as a career. I like working with other people to reach a common goal. For example, the one thing I enjoy the most about Honors Chemistry is conducting experiments with my lab partners. I admit that I have the tendency to take the leadership role and that my lab partners look to me for guidance, but everyone contributes to the successful completion of the experiment and the write up of the lab report. In addition, logical thinking and critical analysis as well as good communication skills are necessary for problem solving. I am confident that I possess these essential skills, but I look forward to refining these skills over the summer at C-Tech².
","I am a member of the varsity tennis team for my high school. The girls on my team are talented and we have been fortunate to have made it to the state championships at Hershey, Pennsylvania for the past two years. Since Hershey is more than two hours away, the team had to stay overnight to compete Friday and Saturday and ran into some room selection problems two years ago. What should have been an exciting time started out very stressful for everyone. I am not sure if adults can fully appreciate the constant drama of high school life. The coaches did not assign roommates. They reserved one double and two triple rooms to accommodate the players and left the final room assignments to the two captains. That is when the chaos started. Professional lobbyists could probably learn a few things from teenage girls set on getting their way. The energy expended on the endless texts, clandestine meetings in between classes, and further discussions before and after practice was enough to bring world peace. I hate to admit it, but I was a participant in the entire brouhaha. I vented my frustration to my parents who advised me that one night rooming with someone was not the end of the world and that all I would be doing in the room was sleeping. I knew that was a true statement. I had been to many overnight activities, and I knew the drill. Everyone hung out together, socialized in different rooms, and finally, slept in their own room. The continued distraction was not worth my time. As one of three underclassmen, I approached the other underclassmen about putting an end to the problem by allowing the upperclassmen to pick first. We took one for the team and informed the captains that we were open to rooming with anyone on the team.","In my research of the engineering profession and engineering summer programs, the words of Einstein came to my mind - ""the only source of knowledge is experience."" Knowledge is crucial to determining whether engineering is my calling, and C-Tech² will provide me with firsthand experience necessary for me to obtain that knowledge. This summer, I want to continue to gain meaningful exposure to the engineering field so that I have a better appreciation for the different branches of engineering and the engineering profession. In addition, I want to immerse myself fully in a residential program to obtain a glimpse of college life at Virginia Tech while learning about engineering. A summer of luxury where participants can focus on anything and everything related to engineering is a welcome change from the fast paced high school life where everyone is juggling numerous academic subjects and extracurricular activities. I cannot wait to explore all of the engineering options available at Virginia Tech, a leading university in the United States.

I am a dedicated and diligent student, but I also love to have fun and enjoy life. Those around me cannot help but laugh when I start my infectious belly laugh at the small things in life. At C-Tech², I can be counted on to be an enthusiastic participant as I thrive on learning new things and challenging myself intellectually. As a year round athlete, I have developed the necessary skills to be both a team player and a leader. I am confident that my leadership and team building skills will be instrumental in building camaraderie while living and working with equally motivated students with the same interest in engineering at C-Tech².

",,"As a kid, everyone around me knew what they wanted to be when they were older. I never put much thought into it, as a child. When I was growing up, I was always eager to create and build, whether it be a lego set or helping my dad build furniture. As I got older, I learned more and more about tools and how they operated. In school, I understood the concepts of math with ease and was fascinated with science. I would ask my math teachers questions about the lesson because I was curious would want to learn more. My math teacher told me what engineering was and I immediately knew what I wanted to do when I was older. As I got older and went into middle school I took algebra in eighth grade and an algebra camp in the summer. A girl I knew, who was studying civil engineering at the time, was a huge inspiration to me and she kept me motivated. I asked her questions about her classes and I was reassured that I wanted to study engineering. I soon went into high school I began to notice more about the world in which we live in today. There are so many needs and I want to be able to help. When students at Virginia Tech helped with the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, I realized I could study engineering and also help people. Now I am sure that I want to be an engineer and be an inspiration for any other girls who want to be an engineer. I know it will not be easy but I am determined and willing to work hard to fulfill my dream and become an engineer. ","Problem solving is crucial to engineering and is necessary for anyone in life. There are good and bad ways to come to a solution to problems. Finding out the good way to a solution, is what is difficult. I am frequently in a problem solving situation because my science class has weekly labs. In these labs, the class splits up into groups of 4 and we are given directions on how to conduct an experiment. The group works together to perform the experiment and collect data on it. We then get a packet or worksheet with questions to answer. The group splits up the work of the experiment and we discuss the questions asked and answer in our own words. I currently take two science classes, Physics and Anatomy, so I have a lab twice a week. I am also part of the school choir, and a couple weeks ago we went to compete against other schools in the area. The choir met up for warm ups but the director was running late. The choir did not know what to do and just stood around. I took initiative and, with a couple other girls, told everyone to get in order. We began to start singing our warm ups and were prepared for when our director came. When it comes to problem solving, there is no easy solution. Sometimes, one needs to take charge and listen to other ideas to tie them all in together into one solution. Other times, groups can work together and come to a solution by compromising and listening to each other. Problem solving is important to know, especially with a group of people. 
","I would be a great choice for this summer camp because I am dedicated, I get along with others, and I will work hard to learn the most that I can in the camp. I am diligent and will not stop working hard until I cannot work any more. I have worked hard in my high school to get the most out of a small school. I will not settle for average and will take the more difficult course to learn the most I can. I know that things will not get handed to me and I work hard to get what I want. Many people give up on their dreams because it gets tough or because of too much pressure. I will never give up on my dream and will always work to become an engineer one day. This camp will show me much more of engineering and what to expect going into this field of study. I also get along with many people and would love to work with others in teams. An exciting aspect of engineering is being able to work with others to come to a solution to a problem. I am a well-rounded student at school as I am involved in almost all things I am able to join at school. I can socialize with the musicians in my orchestra class, my teammates on the basketball team, or even my classmates in my math class. I am always excited to meet new people and learn how to work together with them. Lastly, I will work hard to learn as much as I can at the camp. I am a quick learner and will love to work with others and learn with them what it means to be an engineer. This camp is great for girls who want to experience how to be an engineer. I would appreciate it and be grateful to be able to take part in such a huge opportunity.

CPR/AED/First Aid, American Red Cross, December 2016","BLAST, Virginia Space Grant Consortium, Virginia Tech, July 2015:  On-campus program for students interested in STEM fields providing hands-on exposure to various engineering fields.","I want to major in engineering for several reasons, the primary of these reasons being that I am a good candidate for this field of study. I have always received strong test scores in problem solving and mathematics, both of which I am passionate about. I believe engineering will allow me to strengthen these areas of study.

I greet a challenge, whether it is through school, physical activity, or mental exercise in which I am required to use my imagination and critical thinking skills to solve a problem. I am not afraid to struggle to reach my goals – it gives a true sense of meaning to what I do. As an engineer, I would achieve this same sense of meaning through my studies, and later throughout my career.

I love to learn. When given a chance to expand my horizons, I grasp the opportunity. I am always working to improve myself academically and culturally. As a driven student, engineering would push me to my full academic potential and provide opportunities to work with people with diverse backgrounds and interests.

Shortly after attending the Building Leaders in Advanced Science and Technology (BLAST) Program at Virginia Tech in 2015, I discovered how much I truly enjoy the engineering community. I met people with similar mindsets and goals, all of which were as motivated as I am to succeed in school and beyond. BLAST greatly influenced my love of mathematics and science; it was there that I learned what I am truly capable of. Studying engineering will prepare me to do anything I choose later in life because it will provide me with a broad skillset applicable to many fields in science, business, and education.  ","Last year, I enrolled in a Conceptual Physics class. At the end of the first semester, the instructor assigned a case study: a debate in which two teams would argue in favor or against supersonic flight before a panel of judges. Our team was terribly unprepared, and our presentation was only a week away. We had no slides, no designated speaker, and no presentation plan. We were about to be pulverized. 

Not ready to give up, I helped delegate tasks among our team members, assigning tasks by personality and people’s capabilities. We asked our technically gifted team member to create slides, and our highly organized member to write a presentation plan. We were making the best of our team’s abilities.

Still not fully prepared, and only a few days away from our presentation, we sent the slides to all members of our team for review. Once everyone was familiar with the information we were presenting, we allotted the slides among ourselves and put them in order of presentation. Our presentation was complete, but our debate notes were far from ready.

Desperate, we managed to produce a working plan – when a question came up, whosever’s slide it related to would answer. It was not the ideal plan, but it would have to work since we were out of time and class was the following day.

On the day of the case study, everyone was extremely anxious. Although we stumbled in certain areas, we won the case study and received high scores for our presentation. Ultimately, we had managed to produce a presentation in three weeks, develop a last minute debate strategy, and had successfully won our case. We learned in three weeks how to work as an effective and successful team.","I am a good candidate for this program because of my interest in engineering and my academic abilities. I am innovative, imaginative, hard working, and determined to succeed in school and beyond. As a young woman passionate about a future career in engineering, this program will provide me with the opportunity to meet other girls who share my interests and love of engineering.

After participating in the Building Leaders in Advanced Science and Technology (BLAST) Program at Virginia Tech, I am motivated to find similar programs that will broaden my experience in engineering, introduce me to new people, try new things, and expand my cognitive abilities to their fullest.

When I participated in BLAST in 2015, I was surprised how quickly I was drawn to Virginia Tech and the Engineering Department. I immediately felt comfortable with the environment, a place I could be myself. It was the first place I ever felt I would be appreciated for who I am and that no one would stop me from achieving my goals. I look to the dream of becoming a student in the College of Engineering at Virginia Tech or another institution of high engineering caliber. 

By participating in C-Tech2, I will learn more about engineering in a hands-on manner that will prepare me for an engineering major. I love to learn and challenge myself, and engineering is the challenge I look forward to with enthusiasm. I see this camp as an opportunity to prepare myself for the challenge ahead.","By checking this box, I am electronically signing this online application and acknowledging that the information I have provided is accurate to the best of my knowledge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Drama Department, Techie and Sound Board Operator",,"This is a question that I ask myself a lot, because wanting to be an engineer is just something that I've always said and strived for. Earlier in life, I really wanted to be a teacher because I loved being able to help others. As I got older, I realized more and more that I am still able to help and teach others while making a difference in the world. Being an engineer, I hope that I am able to bring my ideas and knowledge and create something great in this field. Engineering is so extensive and varied, I hope that I am able to enter programs like this and college and be able to find which field of engineering best fits me. On the more academic side of my motivation, I have always been good at math and science courses. My junior year I have been able to take physics and calculus courses that not only make me use basic math and science skills, but actually use higher level thinking and application. I have never experienced classes or learning like this, and this year more than ever I have been shown that I thrive under having to thoroughly think through problems that I am not able to just get a numerical or simple answer for. I want to be an engineer for the element of creation, application, and overall insight to the higher thinking of today's issues and production.","One of the things that has made me the person and student that I am today is Junior Civitan. Junior Civitan is an international service organization dedicated to serving the people and communities around us, with a specific hand to special needs. I began in the organization my freshman year, and I started in leadership roles last year as President of my school club and Lt.Governor for my District, and this year as club president again and Governor of my district. Not only have I been able to lead our club of ten members to over one hundred members through numerous service and fundraising opportunities, I have been able to better my leadership and communication skills. It is so important to me that I learn real life skills, and not just be good at the things that high school wants me to be good at. Within Junior Civitan, working in groups is basically all that we do. Being the leader of both the school club and the district, I have to be able to understand where people are coming from in order to best solve problems. Within our club, we noticed that elementary schools around our town were having trouble finding volunteers to help with extra reading time for students. With the help of the counselors at the different schools, I was able to set up an ""Adopt-a-classroom"" program for our members to go and help in schools after a full day of schooling. A more person to person problem we see is making sure that people are able to calmly and kindly relate to each other. I make sure that these large groups of people and I are able to work together and create genuine and productive relationships.","The reason I should be selected for this program is because I believe that I am an unconventional student and person. I'm not afraid to be in charge or share my opinion when no one else will. I like the attention and I'm usually pretty outward with my personality and opinions. I'm a leader in my school, community, and world through Junior Civitan, and I have had countless opportunities for public speaking, which has made me into a well spoken person. I'm not just an intelligent student that is quiet and doesn't really have that voice; I am a presence in a room, and I love conversing with others and sharing ideas. For the longest time I wanted to be a teacher, because I love the feeling of helping other people and being able to help someone understand something new. That interest and passion of mine is still here, but I believe that I am better off to use my knowledge and motivation in another area, engineering. My desire to teach and help others is used in my life through school and organizations like Junior Civitan and being a part of my school's leadership retreat committee. I want to be selected for colleges or programs like this because I am able to bring something to the table, that I am able to have something different in me that can bring out the difference in others. I believe that I will thrive in a college atmosphere, I always work best when I am completely engulfed in my studies and work, so a program like this should be perfect for me.
