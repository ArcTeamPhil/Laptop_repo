* [[http://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/15/5/11387/htm][Determining the Leaf Emissivity of Three Crops by Infrared Thermometer]] 
** infrared thermometer + thermocouple wirE, simple and novel technique was developed to determine the emissivities of leaves for three horticultural crops using an infrared thermometer.
** Test guesses for emissivity by assuming constant distrubition of temp across plant
** Integrating across all wavelengths
** epsilon = 0.9809, 0.9783, 0.981, 0.9848 for Phalaenopsis mature and new leaves and Paphiopedilum and Malabar chestnut leaves
*** Experimental section
**** total rad = object + reflections + transmission
***** transmission isgnored
***** R_t = epsilon * alpha * T^4_leaf + (1 - epsilon) * alpha * T^4_ref_bckgnd [W/m-2]
***** E_ircam = epsiloThe target temperature for calibration was maintained at 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40 °C n_ircam * T^4_ircam_detected + E_error    (IR camera)
***** E_thermo = epsilon_thermo * T^4_thermo   (thermocouple)
***** assum E_ircam == E_thermo
***** assume epsilon_thermo = epsilon_ircam
**** Thermometers
***** The target temperature for calibration was maintained at 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40 deg C 
**** Measurement:
***** Done at Night for min radiation
***** thermocouple attached with permeable tape
***** measurements taken with syncronized thermocouple + IR

** portable infrared thermometer to measure foliage temperature and calculate a crop water stress index (CWSI)
*** theory:
**** biological emissivity 0.9-0.99 in 105-12.5 um band, plants 0.97-0.99
**** shade for 20-30 sec changes temp significantly
**** compare T_foliage to T_air
***** look for transpiration loss, compare to well watered plant response
****** humid environments skew results negatively
*** "Recently,  foliage  temperatures  have  been  related  to  the  temperature  response  of  the  enzymes  within  the  plant.  Burke  and  Hatfield (1987)  showed  that  it  was  necessary  to  consider  the  foliage  temperature-enzyme  activity  relationship  to  fully  quantify  the  protection  level  of  glutathione  reductase  in  field-grown  wheat"
**** while night --> plant == air temp --> day --> temps good for enzyme function --> temp increase
***** dependednt on : soil water availability, net radiation, air temperatures
***** temp differences: 23-32 C (cotton), 10-17 C (spinach), 30-40 C (cucumber) between ait to plant
***** more variability as soil water decreased
***** flowers --> no transipration --> 5 C higher

IR Camera

** method of monitoring stomatal closure of grapevines in the field with infrared thermography
*** wet and dry reference surfaces to eliminate non-leaves
**** Background:
***** Crop Water Stress Index CWSI --> determiine underwatered crops
****** issues: not useful in humid climates
****** if too broad, included non vegetation in measeaurement (soil)
***** Reference Surfaces allows for scaling of test for current conditions
****** assumes model and reference are similar
****** use wet or petroleum covered leaves for ensuring equivalent radioactive properties
***** "variation in temperature could be a more sensitive measure of mean leaf conductance than was mean temperature itself."
***** variation increases as stomata close
**** Imaging
***** "The background temperature required for calculation of object temperatures was estimated as the radiative temperature of a crumpled aluminium foil sheet placed in as similar as possible a position as the object being viewed, with emissivity set at 1.0; emissivity was set at 0.95 for viewing leaves."
***** subtracted correction by imagin with lens cap on at intervals during testing
**** Results
***** filter paper (wet/dry), leaves (wet/dry) 
****** set upper and lower bounds to image analysis
***** avg temps + freq distrubution of temps over area
***** greater variance for plants in sunlight 25% - 42% and with larger pixels
**** Illumination
***** "The sensitivity of Tleaf to changes in stomatal conductance, and hence the utility of thermal imaging for the study of stomatal conductance, depends both on the absorbed radiation and on the boundary layer conductance and atmospheric humidity."
***** sunlit leaves better for stomatal conductance
***** reference objects experienced high variance from small size and changing level of wetness
