** infrared thermometer + thermocouple wirE, simple and novel technique was developed to determine the emissivities of leaves for three horticultural crops using an infrared thermometer.
*** Experimental section
**** total rad = object + reflections + transmission
***** transmission isgnored
***** R_t = epsilon * alpha * T^4_leaf + (1 - epsilon) * alpha * T^4_ref_bckgnd [W/m-2]
***** E_ircam = epsiloThe target temperature for calibration was maintained at 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40 °C n_ircam * T^4_ircam_detected + E_error    (IR camera)
***** E_thermo = epsilon_thermo * T^4_thermo   (thermocouple)
***** assum E_ircam == E_thermo
***** assume epsilon_thermo = epsilon_ircam
**** Thermometers
***** The target temperature for calibration was maintained at 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40 deg C 
**** Measurement:
***** Done at Night for min radiation
***** thermocouple attached with permeable tape
***** measurements taken with syncronized thermocouple + IR
